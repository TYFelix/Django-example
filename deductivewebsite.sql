INSERT INTO `aldryn_newsblog_article_translation` VALUES (1, 'en', 'The emergence of the algorithm economy', 'emergence-algorithm-economy', '<p>Algorithms are an essential feature of data science. So much so that Airbnb, who have a sophisticated data team, recently divided their group into <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/dont-do-data-science-solve-business-problems-6b70c4ee0083\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Analytics, Algorithms, and Inference teams, showing how essential algorithms are</a>. Most people have heard of them but are unaware of what exactly they are, or what they do beyond say understanding that Google uses algorithms to ensure spammers don\'t appear as the number one search term on their search engine and Facebook use them to ensure fake news doesn\'t appear in our timelines. However, the emergence of the algorithm economy is driving uses which go far beyond Google and Facebook and are useful in trying to resolve any kind of business problem.</p>\n\n<p>Any business which is navigating through the digital world and doesn\'t use algorithms must harness the power of algorithms to enhance their business.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What\'s the business problem?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Algorithms can solve many business problems. For instance, if recruitment is a big problem in your company and you have plenty of applicants but choosing the best one is turning out to be difficult, algorithms can help reduce say 100 candidates to a pool of five whom the company can then interview. Ensuring that the workforce is not too homogenous can also be done through algorithms, whether because the company wants diversity in the workforce rather than say just employing men, or because they want employees with a diverse range of experiences and personalities.</p>\n\n<p>If fraud is a big problem, an algorithm can be advantageous in identifying the kind of behavior that customers engaged in fraud have shown in the past in actual customers. Imagine the algorithm flagging three transactions out of a base of a few thousand. These suspicious transactions can then be analyzed by employees, whereas it would be economically unrealistic to get staff to analyze each of the several thousand transactions. Enterprises also use algorithms in trying to predict who among candidates for a job may steal from the company itself, vital given the importance of having loyal and honest staff. Imagine there are some important decisions the company\'s top-level executives need to make about spending or buying over the next year. Algorithms can help those controlling the business by ensuring that, of all the big data the company has that could relate to these spending decisions, it is the critical pieces of information which will end up in front of these executives in reports.</p>\n\n<p>Other areas where algorithms can make a real difference to the business include recommendations. The recommendations we all know are when a website sees you have read a specific article or watched a particular video and recommends other articles or videos, perhaps based on this single choice or probably on your personal history of choosing on the website. Recommendations are particularly useful in e-commerce sites.</p>\n\n<p>Algorithms are also used extensively in marketing and to help marketers understand their customers and potential customers better. We have already blogged about <a href=\"/blogs/tv-analytics-101-clv/\">Customer Lifetime Value</a>, <a href=\"/blogs/segmentation-relevant/\">segmentation</a> of customers and <a href=\"/case-studies/churn-prediction-retention/\">churn</a>. Well written algorithms can help segment customers, build a CLV for each customer, and make predictions about churn.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How do we build an algorithm?</strong></p>\n\n<p>So you have some business problems and a great data science team, so how do you go about constructing appropriate algorithms that resolve the issues? Now it may be that the data science team is not that part of the business with the best insights into what the real business problems are. It is essential that, if this is the case, then those who are best placed within the business to know what the real business problems are, collaborate with the data science team rather than thinking the data scientists will somehow magically know what the real business problems are. Once these are understood, the next step is to outline whichever business problem the team wants to fix, by documenting it. This process of writing about the issue will help the team think about the dilemmas involved. It is much easier to propose solutions than to identify core problems, and, given human nature, many people would rather others see them as someone who comes up with a brilliant solution rather than actually having to do the harder, more tedious work of identifying real business problems that the company can do something to fix. This last bit is essential. It\'s no use a UK company identifying Brexit as a business problem given the company cannot do anything about such political issues.</p>\n\n<p>If the team identify the wrong problem, and the company then spends time and money trying to fix it, but, as things pan out three months later, it becomes clear that the team identified the wrong problem, then the business will have wasted lots of time and money. Hence our stressing the critical importance of identifying the right issues in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>The second step is to see what data are available. If this isn\'t the first business problem the team is approaching, then you should already have a good idea of what overall data is in the enterprise. However, not all of the data will likely be relevant to this particular problem, so the next step is to see what relevant datasets are available as well as what datasets aren\'t related. It is also a good idea for the team to ask themselves if there are data which aren\'t currently available but which could really help resolve the business problem, and then to see whether the company can obtain those data itself, or perhaps buy them as third-party data from another company. Assuming that the team has already resolved <a href=\"/case-studies/scoring-data-quality/\">data quality</a> for the data stored by the company, it is vital that any new datasets are adequately cleansed and validated. Having only high-quality data is essential as algorithms which have to work with weak quality data are going to fail, unless, of course, the algorithm has been specifically written to address data quality issues, as algorithms are great for doing this, and many a budding data scientist will find they write their first algorithm to address data quality issues. A data cleansing algorithm is required whenever there are datasets which have mismatched or low-quality data. Integrating different datasets is a classic data quality issue due to standardization issues.</p>\n\n<p>Once genuine business problems have been identified, and all the relevant data that could shed light on the question are ready, the team can apply an algorithm to the data. These algorithms aren\'t magic that will automatically solve the problem merely by parsing them through the data. However, algorithms can provide information from which the company can resolve the issue, and are a crucial element in the toolbox of any competent data science team.</p>\n\n<p>Welcome to the algorithm economy.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 1, 1);
INSERT INTO `aldryn_newsblog_article_translation` VALUES (2, 'en', 'Build your own recommendation engine', 'build-recommendation-engine', '<p>Recommendations, or recommender systems, are one of the most powerful tools within the data science toolkit. Some recommendation engines focus on the top-level executives within a company, such as those who make the decisions about what is going to be available on Netflix or similar OTT services this autumn or those who make the spending decisions in any large company. However, the vast majority of recommendations are customer-focused, and these are the ones that are most common in the media industry.</p>\n\n<p>A recommender system is simply an algorithm which examines the products and services offered by the company and then provides them as recommendations to customers. The analog comparison is if a woman goes to a dress shop wanting a dress. The skilled employee can recommend one or more to her, perhaps based on her previous experience of this customer shopping in the store and even if it is her first time in the place, based on such things as her size, her hair color, and suchlike. The recommender system tries to do the same by drawing on the data available about the products available and the customer, to try and find the best match for customer and product.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"understanding-the-customer\">Understanding the customer</h2>\n\n<p>We would argue that for businesses in 2019 which use a recommender system, getting recommendations consistently right (or wrong) can make or break that company, like Netflix, among others, have demonstrated, which means that getting the system right is of critical importance to any enterprise using one. Moreover, the first step the data science team needs to take in building a recommender system is to understand the customer.</p>\n\n<p>The main reason businesses need to use recommender systems with online customers is because of the sheer range of choice available. When someone wanted to buy a TV in the past, they\'d go to a store, which would have perhaps 50 different types of TV. Contrast this to the digital world where the customer might have a choice of 5000 or more separate devices. The appearance of the product is going to be less critical for the digital consumer than the things the TV does (is it a smart TV?) whereas a consumer in a store might pick one set simply because they like the look of it. The same deluge of choice happens with watching TV, so in the analog era there were perhaps 50 channels and the consumer had to choose one out of fifty, but if they go into YouTube there are millions of possible shows the consumer could watch. So when recommender systems work well, they allow the consumer to swiftly and smoothly find what they want in a world swamped with choice.</p>\n\n<p>Search engines also play an essential role in helping consumers find what they want but are better suited to consumers who know what they are looking for but are not sure where to find it, so they ask the search engine. If a consumer wants to watch Breaking Bad tonight, a search engine will help them see where they can watch it. People don\'t always know what they want to watch, though, and often they want to watch a TV show that they are going to enjoy. Giving a different example, perhaps someone gets a bonus at work or a small inheritance and is unsure what to spend it on; all they know is that they want to buy something from an e-commerce site. Recommendations work best where people have an idea of what they want but aren\'t that specific. If the offer is good, so that the viewer, thanks to the recommender system, finds something to watch or buy that they then really enjoy, they will likely use the recommender system, and hence your site, again in the future. Recommendations are great for customer retention, always a key goal for any business.</p>\n\n<p>We are seeing recommendations for customers everywhere online, whether it is Amazon suggesting we might like product B because we bought product A or a TV broadcaster recommends we might like Russian Doll because we devoured Game of Thrones. These examples may sound simple but if a recommender system is to have real value for customers it needs to work well every time and for every customer, and just as there are typically a wide variety of products and services, so there are masses of customers, all with different likes and tastes.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"understanding-the-product\">Understanding the product</h2>\n\n<p>For a recommender system to function well, the team needs not merely to understand the customers but also to understand the products or services. If the product is a fridge, this is relatively easy but, if it is a new TV show, such as Chernobyl, it isn\'t reasonable to expect a member of the team to watch the show while taking notes to generate the data required about the show for the recommender system. Especially given there are likely thousands of TV shows which the system might recommend. However, it is likely that the company already has many data about this and other shows. So Chernobyl has already been <a href=\"/segmentation-relevant/\">segmented</a> as a historical drama by critics, there have already been many reviewers who have watched the show (some professional, some amateur) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernobyl_(miniseries)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">according to Wikipedia</a> \"the show was acclaimed by critics, with particular praise towards historical accuracy and attention to detail.\"</p>\n\n<p>Thus the data is the key to understanding both the product and the customer. The way to use the data available in building the recommender system is by giving attributes to both the product and the customer. Giving characteristics to a product allows the recommender system to rate it for specific factors, which it can then match to relevant customers. The team achieves this attribution by using the data to extract as many attributes about the product as possible. For instance, historically accurate might be an attribution for a drama. Thus dramas with this accuracy attribute would make suitable recommendations for a lover of historical and factual documentaries. A historically inaccurate program such as The Tudors equally might receive a historically incorrect attribution and would thus make a better recommendation for a lover of fictional shows, for whom historical accuracy is unimportant.</p>\n\n<p>It is also necessary to compare products with each other, using the attribution system the team has devised, as a fan of one show will be likely to enjoy a second show if the two shows share many attributes. The key to this, once all the team has collected and <a href=\"/blogs/data-cleansing/\">cleansed</a> the relevant datasets, is to <a href=\"/blogs/data-mining/\">data mine</a> the data for specific patterns, and applying business rules which the team has created. These patterns and rules allow each product and each customer to receive multiple attributions. So the team might define a TV viewing customer as having a high score for documentaries and historically accurate dramas and a low score for sport and comedies while the team also attributes shows (the product) with similar descriptions, such as a documentary, a comedy. Ideally, the team can also mine a 400-word synopsis or review of the show for the specific attributes the team is looking for within the text. Once the characteristics are all in place, the recommender system should easily be able to match the customer with product and also a product with another product, so if a consumer likes product A, she will probably like product B.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"so-how-do-we-build-one\">So how do we build one?</h2>\n\n<p>Ten years ago, building a recommender system was an extremely challenging task beyond anyone without years of experience in statistics and computer programming, meaning that most companies which wanted to use one had no real options other than to use a commercially available product. However, in 2019, it is relatively simple for anyone with some programming knowledge to build such a system using Python, the general purpose programming language. While it is unlikely that a first attempt to create one will match some of the sophisticated recommender systems built by the likes of YouTube and Amazon, making your own can help you begin to understand the process of constructing recommender systems better, which will then allow you and your team to build more complex and improved methods.</p>\n\n<p>In a content-based recommender, we categorize all the items (perhaps e-commerce products, TV shows or songs) genres and other essential attributes with the fundamental rating concept being that those who like something will probably like something similar.</p>\n\n<p>In a collaborative filtering recommender, the rating is calculated using a type of predictive analytics which tries to estimate how users will rate future items based on how other users rated similar past items. Unlike with content-based systems, collaborative filters don\'t require the attribution of items.</p>\n\n<p>When building a collaborative filtering recommender, the focus isn\'t on the attributes of the services or products but instead on the customers and their customer behavior. So if person Y likes a product and person Z has similar tastes, then the recommender can recommend the product to person B. Products are still used in this system but are now customer-focused. So if X and Y like two products, the recommender can identify them as similar and when person Z buys either one of the products, the recommender can recommend the other product. The difference is that in the content-based system it was the attributes of the products and services that the recommender focused on and with the collaborative filtering the focus is entirely on customer behaviors, and this means using different datasets and different formulas to build the recommender.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 2, 1);

After the rush last May to ensure that businesses were going to be compliant when it came to storing and using (or selling!) the private personal information (PII) data they store about individuals, we thought we would take a look at the post-GDPR landscape. How has this regulation affected businesses, both within and outside the EU? The law affects any websites in EU countries, regardless of the location of the company. Many American websites, such as a thousand local news sites, have blocked users from EU countries from accessing their websites, thus ensuring they store nothing about people within the EU, including their IP addresses. <a href=\"https://deductive.com/blinding-identity-taxonomy\">The blinding identity taxonomy initiative</a> has identified 46 different elements, including IP addresses, as needing privacy protection. However, the majority of websites worldwide continue to have a presence within the EU, which means they have had to focus on ensuring the privacy of whichever of the 46 BIT elements they store about their users based in the EU.</p>\n\n<p>One of the impacts which interest us is that the number of 3rd-party cookies on news websites within the EU has fallen by 22% since GDPR came into force; these might be cookies used by advertisers who have a banner or an ad on a news site. This drop was measured between April 2018, before GDPR became law, and July of the same year and focussed on seven EU countries: the U.K., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Finland, and Poland. Interestingly this percentage varies between these seven countries, with Germany having a low drop of 6% and the UK a high rate of 45%. It appears that these news organizations are banning tracking cookies from 3rd parties until a user gives their permission to the terms and conditions of the website. However, many sites have also been thoroughly reviewed by their owners with unnecessary coding and features removed, which itself will have contributed to the reduction in 3rd party cookies. Interestingly, tests done since GDPR have shown that the news website USA Today takes nearly ten seconds to load with a fast Internet connection in the US and less than half a second in the UK under the same conditions. This variation in speeds leads to the conclusion that there have been considerable falls in 3rd party cookies and other web site elements that will slow down the loading of a page.</p>\n\n<p>GDPR has powers to impose fines on companies up to 20 million euros or 4% of annual world turnover if the latter figure is higher than 20 million, and while we still haven\'t heard of significant cases of GDPR in the news, there have till now been 56 million euros worth of fines imposed. Extreme cases take a long time to prepare, and both the UK and Irish governments claim there will be significant cases, which will hit the news, developing over the summer. However, 41% of UK citizens in a recent survey expressed dissatisfaction with the way companies look after their PII data, with 12% shutting down a social media account due to data breach news stories.</p>\n\n<p>One of the phenomena we saw in the weeks leading up to GDPR is what we would call \"pass the liability\" activities, also described as \"hot potato\" where everyone tries to ensure that someone else is liable under GDPR and not them. Lawyers have made much hay encouraging the re-writing of contracts in the case of problems with the authorities re GDPR. For instance, publishers who sell ad space are producing deals that make those whose ads they display responsible for paying any fine imposed under GDPR while agencies are tweaking their contracts with those they buy data from to ensure that those who provided the data hold the responsibility. Should any GDPR cases reach the courts, the number of parties involved will be astronomical.</p>\n\n<p>Consumers are also experiencing opt-in fatigue. With the spread of social media, it is easy for even a casual user to access 50 or 100 different websites in a week. Paradoxically, those who are most suspicious of privacy abuses are those who are also most likely to flush out their cookies. Either after every session or say weekly, and yet this unquestionably increases the fatigue as each website asks the user to sign their consent to use the site once again every time it installs one or more new cookies in the browser. Those who refuse may still be able to access the website, but refusing to consent will increase the fatigue as every page now requests that the user opts-in. The best way to combat opt-in fatigue is not to remove any cookies from the web browser and not to read the terms and conditions but to tick the box instead. Even so, a typical user will spend more time than they want ticking boxes. This box-ticking is not what the EU intended.</p>\n\n<p>Opt-in fatigue is also a big issue in marketing, because, as with web sites, marketing communications require consent. So if I enjoyed having products marketed to me via email and often signed up to such schemes, when available, I would almost certainly have been inundated with requests to confirm my consent to receiving these emails and allowing these companies to store my PII data. I signed up for marketing information and, as an average user, am likely to be irritated and exhausted by all this \"junk mail\" which I describe as such because it isn\'t the marketing info I want. Moreover, yet if companies fail to send me these emails asking for consent and opt-in, they are placing themselves in a very vulnerable situation as it only takes one complaint, perhaps from an atypical user, to see a company in court, facing the possibility of a hefty fine and damage to their brand reputation.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 3, 11);

Driven by the extraordinary success of Netflix and its rivals such as Hulu, lots of long-established programming groups are now offering their own D2C services instead of or as an accompaniment to the linear TV experience offering shows to watch rather than channels. Pundits are counting on Disney\'s forthcoming service to shake-up the industry, but the reality is that D2C is already a shake-up in itself.</p>\n\n<p>Implementing a D2C service represents a significant change for programmers, who are effectively now in a new business, something they often underestimate. While the hype around D2C and D2C generally might make it look like an easy way to success, the reality is that launching a successful D2C business is not as simple as Netflix has made it seem.</p>\n\n<p>Our data science consulting team says that with D2C, these companies now own the customer relationship, and, because of this, they need to communicate with their customers to discover what they want from their TV experience. They are also now directly responsible for doing an initial data audit, ensuring accurate reporting, creating a <a href=\"/blogs/tv-analytics-101-clv/\">Customer Lifetime View</a> (CLV), and delivering the critical goals of customer acquisition and retention for subscribers to their D2C services. All these key activities need to be grounded in the data the company has, which once the D2C service is up and running will be considerably more than the data they had (or still have) from any linear services. Unquestionably the great attraction of D2C, apart from its high popularity among customers who like to choose what they want to watch and when, is the data. However, to get the best out of these data, companies need to have a firm grasp of best data sciences practices in using data and in the technologies which generate and process the data as well as develop a data strategy and its own data initiatives.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"data-audit-and-reporting\">Data audit and reporting</h2>\n\n<p>Doing a <a href=\"/case-studies/data-science-starts-data-audit/\">data audit</a> is the first step companies should take when implementing or planning to implement D2C, with the long-term goal being to improve customer acquisition and retention. This audit should begin by looking at business-as-usual (BAU) reports and then working out how ideal BAU reports would look. These ideal reports can then represent the goals the company should have for how its data functions, stating which technologies it will use, followed up by seeing what the company would like to achieve with these new OTT data. If the team can identify the gaps between their ambitions and the reality of the data, this is the essence of the data audit.</p>\n\n<p>What factors drive customers to engage with a particular business? Or to decide to no longer do so? Companies need to define which metrics are the key to understanding customers and to assess what reporting the company is already doing and how they can improve upon their reports by using the data to answer these questions about customers. The reporting is particularly important because, in the vast majority of businesses, it is not the data scientists who make the critical decisions that will affect customer metrics, it is the high-level executives who make all the crucial decisions. They need the best and most comprehensive possible reports. To a large extent, the job of the data scientists is to give these executives easy-to-read reports which allow them to use the data to help them in making these critical decisions. The best place to start, assuming reporting is already happening, is to review the mandatory reporting and look for easy ways to improve it. By implementing a BAU review of the complete dataset, there may also figure out further ways to improve the reporting.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customer-lifetime-value\">Customer lifetime value</h2>\n\n<p>D2C data fundamentally helps companies understand their customers, but this needs a framework so everybody in the business can better comprehend what factors are making customers sign-up to your service or stop subscribing. This is also where having a <a href=\"/blogs/advanced-advertising-promise/\">Customer Lifetime Value</a> (CLV) formula. The CLV is an estimate of the monetary value of the worth of an average single customer to a company during the entire period that they are customers of that company. The CLV can then be applied to each acquired customer and can be an advantageous asset, especially for communicating with customers. With this CLV in place, we recommend starting an initiative which encourages users to sign-up for the service on offer by the company and that this initiative is then used to drive forward a vision of a <a href=\"/blogs/tv-analytics-101-scv/\">Single Customer View</a>, where the company can easily view the data on each customer on a single page.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customer-acquisition-and-retention\">Customer acquisition and retention</h2>\n\n<p>The next task is to build models that can help the business acquire and retain customers. Examples of these models include building a model to identify customers, both actual and potential, who are likely to experience churn or a model identifying the main reasons why customers have signed up for the service in the past, noting the reasons, with percentages of customers giving each reason who then left the service. So if 40% of those who don\'t stay signed-up for your service because of the sports coverage, and only 10% because of the dramas, then the company likely needs to focus on improving its sports coverage to retain the maximum number of customers. Another critical area to look at is the process that drove a customer to choose your service. Did they want a D2C service and then pick you from a range of possibilities? Or was there some other factor than the D2C which brought them to your D2C, such as loyalty to your brand, where they use your linear service and then switch to your D2C service.</p>\n\n<p>Taking another example, if a customer comes to your website and then signs-up for S2C from a Facebook ad, a simple explanation would attribute that customer to the Facebook ad, with all the ROI implications this brings, but the reality of what brought the customer to your service via the Facebook may be more complex. Perhaps they had been thinking of subscribing to a TV service, and the Facebook ad got the customer to act. Also of interest, is seeing what percentage of acquired customers through Facebook ads then don\'t renew their subscriptions or how many customers who signed up through brand loyalty or through wanting a TV service then subsequently don\'t renew their subscription. The clearer the picture the data science team can build of customer motivations, the better the understanding will be for the business. The key elements are learning where the customer came from, why they signed up, following the conversion rate, i.e., what converts someone who sees say your Facebook ad into a paying customer, or the person who visits your website (whether from Facebook or not) into a paying customer. Finally, there is the retention rate (or usage rate), which tries to identify who are the most loyal customers and then looks at where they came from and why they signed up.</p>\n\n<p>Any data strategy should be pro-active and include data initiatives, particularly when an established company is making its first entrance into STC. By focussing on the customer and developing the models and formulas which we have outlined in this article, companies can give themselves a fighting chance of offering a successful DTC service that customers will want to sign-up to and won\'t want to leave.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 4, 6);
INSERT INTO `aldryn_newsblog_article_translation` VALUES (6, 'en', 'The California Privacy Act and the future of data privacy', 'california-privacy-act', '<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which comes into force at the beginning of next year, is, like the European Union\'s GDPR, a data law focussing on protecting the privacy of consumers. While legally it will only come into force in California, the rest of the country is watching it keenly. Other states are considering passing similar laws, and Congress is already considering a federal data law. At the same time, the FTC is already negotiating a multi-billion dollar fine with Facebook for the company\'s alleged privacy and data lapses. The landscape is starting to change irrevocably, and it\'s clear that data practices are going to have to change.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"no-more-wild-west-of-data\">No more wild west of data</h2>\n\n<p>The CCPA proposes to help consumers protect their privacy by giving them the right to know what personally identifiable information (PII) data companies collect about them and to whom these enterprises are selling or disclosing said data. They also have the right to refuse to allow the selling but not the disclosure of their data when there is no financial gain involved and to access said personal data. Finally, companies need to ensure that they are not discriminating against consumers in terms of services offered or price charged when they do exercise their CCPA rights. Thus the CCPA, like GDPR, endeavors to give consumers control over their PII data, and enforces consumer right to privacy through legislation.</p>\n\n<p>However, unlike GDPR, the CCPA does not apply to all companies that operate in California. Only companies who either have a gross revenue (in total, not solely through operations in California) of more than $25 million or hold PII data of at least 50,000 people or make half their recorded profits from selling on PII data are liable to the conditions carried in CCPA. Meanwhile, GDPR affects all companies who store or use data about people located in the EU while CCPA only protects California residents.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-obligations-of-ccpa\">The obligations of CCPA</h2>\n\n<p>The CCPA makes stringent demands on those companies who are subjects to it. These demands include designing a framework that makes it easy for consumers to request their data, which, as a minimum needs to include a toll-free telephone number. It also includes a link on their website homepage to another page where consumers can demand that the company does not sell their PII data; stricter rules for under 16s, and especially under 13s, and a description of California residents\' rights explicitly stated in their privacy policies.</p>\n\n<p>While these demands look reasonably straightforward, practically speaking it may be challenging to organize the data in such a way as to be able to fulfill the CCPA obligations unless your data engineering team is focused on and trained in how to do so. Getting a toll-free number and links on the website home page aren\'t the concern; the issue is organizing the PII data so well that if Jane Doe demands to see her PII data or to have it deleted that the company can speedily respond to either of her requests.</p>\n\n<p>So if you are a connected car company with gross revenues above $25 million or more than 50,000 cars and therefore clients, then even if you sell no PII data, you are still subject to CCPA. What is the PII data here? The <a href=\"https://kantarainitiative.org/confluence/display/infosharing/Blinding+Identity+Taxonomy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BIT initiative</a> has identified 46 data types that can be considered to be PII. Successfully incorporating this BIT standard means not only having to take care of these PII elements but also of any other data which is linked to any one of these elements and thus could be used to identify a person. We strongly recommend that all companies use the BIT initiative as the basis for identifying PII data and then make sure that they <a href=\"/blogs/data-science-gdpr-pseudonymization-data-pipeline/\">pseudonymize this data</a> in such a way that there is no possibility of connecting any of the elements to other data, which by association then becomes PII data.</p>\n\n<p>In the connected car example, the name or any other personally identifying details of the driver, or even the owner, are PII data. The journeys taken by the car are not PII data unless the driver is identifiable, in which case the whole trip and all trips by all drivers are PII data. Understanding whether the driver is identifiable is in itself challenging. The data points per se may not be PII, but what if you live in a rural part of the country, share a Zipcode with relatively few other people, and make the same journey routinely (say, to work) in your vehicle? The risk of reidentification in this scenario is relatively high.</p>\n\n<p>Selling this data say to supermarkets so that the driver can then receive targetted ads from a supermarket which the driver regularly goes past is then also PII data. Perhaps the driver doesn\'t want his wife to know the route he takes home, for whatever reason, and seeing his targetted ads on social media might make her suspicious that he is taking a route which is different from what she thinks he takes. While this may still sound a little far-fetched, this is only because, as a society, we haven\'t adjusted to the reality of targetted advertising yet.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-key-is-understanding-the-data\">The key is understanding the data</h2>\n\n<p>Thus the first task facing any data science, strategy or engineering team in adjusting to CCPA is to understand the data they have in their business, what datasets are likely to be added, which is PII, and how linking non-PII data to other datasets in the market might make that data identifiable, and therefore PII. Businesses must create a strategy of how to store this data in a way that protects the privacy of a company\'s customers and adheres to the regulations of the CCPA.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of CCPA penalties for non-compliance, the Act demands fines of up to $7,500 for each intentional violation and $2,500 for each unintentional violation. If your data science team has successfully data mined the data and know what it contains and will contain in the future, it becomes much easier to justify any violations and thus minimize any potential fines. Though avoiding CCPA violations isn\'t just about penalties, it is also about preserving the company\'s reputation. If the California authorities take a company to court, and it turned out the business didn\'t really know what data they were storing because they had never fully understood the information they had in their business or did not have the checks and balances in place to stop privacy breaches from happening, this can be reputationally damaging.</p>\n\n<p>By fully understanding what the data contains and which information is considered PII and which isn\'t, most companies should find that as long as they understand what CCPA demands, that compliance ought to be relatively straightforward.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 6, 11);

City planners are using the data produced by smart cities to pioneer the way they run core municipal services, including waste management and water, running schools and hospitals more efficiently, and reducing costs and wastage in service provision.</p>\n\n<p>And just as cars and transport play a vital role in any city, so <a href=\"/blogs/connected-car-services/\">connected vehicles</a> are a critical element to any smart city. The dream of the self-driving, autonomous car is coming but what will come first (and has started to arrive) is mass connectivity across vehicle fleets, where cars generate and share data with multiple other applications.</p>\n\n<p>There are lots of compelling use cases for the data generated by connected cars, around fleet management, insurance provision, infotainment, and so on. But we think smart cities bring an entirely different dimension to the way we will use this data. There are a couple of reasons for this, one technically and one societal. It\'s clear now that the big winners from connected (and autonomous) vehicles will not just be the companies that build and operate these vehicles or the services associated with them, but those that take advantage of the profound changes they will have on our urban landscapes. Connected and autonomous cars will reinvent the way our towns and cities are laid out <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/special-report/2018/03/01/a-chance-to-transform-urban-planning\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">in ways we can\'t even imagine yet</a>. Their impact will be far more significant than the addition of Netflix in your car.</p>\n\n<p>The other difference, more prosaic than the remaking of urban landscapes but still significant, is technology. Today, when we talk about the data connected cars generate, we are often talking about vehicles generating data delivered to the cloud and used to understand traffic flows or to help to plan out new transit routes, or to understand more about how people drive in certain conditions. This is a classic device/server model that we see in multiple other industries. But what we see with the emergence of smart cities is more use of device to device technology - e.g. connected cars passing data between one another, and a whole raft of use cases developing around this.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vehicle-to-vehicle-communication\">Vehicle to vehicle communication</h2>\n\n<p>These technologies, known as vehicle to vehicle communication, are designed to allow automobiles to talk to each other, using wireless ad hoc networks. These technologies are increasingly standardized – in the US, it is called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11p\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Wireless Access in Vehicular Environments (WAVE)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>WAVE and similar technologies are being used to power some of the most exciting smart city technologies. Truckers are starting to use it to work together to, as cyclists do, ride in convoy to reduce drag and fuel use. <a href=\"https://veniam.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/PortoCaseStudy_Letter_2016-04-15.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Multiple cities are using V2V to use vehicles to power mesh wifi networks</a>.</p>\n\n<p>We think this technology will change some of the most fundamental parts of our cityscapes. Take smart traffic lights that don\'t keep people waiting on red when no cars are coming where the light is green. And parking, where the connected vehicle communicates with a car parking system and can tell the driver where a space can be found, thus reducing both the congestion and the pollution caused by frustrated drivers unable to find car parking spaces.</p>\n\n<p>When connected cars speak to each other, this can help lower the number of overall accidents which, among other issues, tend to create enormous traffic delays. With autonomous vehicles, the flow of traffic will improve still further. When cars driven by humans pull away from a traffic light, there is always a delay as everyone has to notice the light has gone green and then get into gear and move off. Cars communicating with each other will do this more efficiently, allowing all the vehicles in the queue to continue their journeys much more swiftly and smoothly.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, connected cars can talk to each other, to pavements and road markings and signs, some obligatory, such as speed limit signs, traffic lights, stop or yield signs or road markings where a car is say prohibited from remaining stationary. This communication can only be useful when the massive amounts of data the connected cars generate are processed and analyzed in real-time. Because the typical things connected cars do in smart cities are in real-time, speed is of the essence. If the car parking space has been taken by another car by the time yours arrives, and this then happens five further times, the \"help\" the smart city is offering the connected car would be worse than no help at all. As cars become autonomous this need for rapid automated, decision-making in real-time will become even more critical. If a driverless car fails to react to a stop sign or to a person in danger of being hit, then death could occur, which, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-autopilot-self-driving-crash-california/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">as we have already seen, could have a catastrophic effect on the public\'s trust in these vehicles.</a>.

The launch of Ethereum in 2015, which features smart contract functionality, is an excellent example of this.</p>\n\n<p>These new technologies are not just about more efficient sharing, movement, and storage of data: there is much higher consumer awareness of the role that the likes of FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) and other giant Web companies, play in our lives.</p>\n\n<p>Take Facebook, founded four and a half years before the launch of the Bitcoin network. The company was technically built using traditional data silos. It was also created with a tacit understanding that, by using the free tools the companies provided, consumers were giving up their data, and that Facebook would use that data to build a revenue model. What is much more debatable is how much customers understand, and are happy with, the likes of Facebook building walled gardens around their data,</p>\n\n<p>If the likes of Facebook launched today, would it be more likely to build on open standards?

Some of the initiatives and technologies that we are working on include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>\n	<p>Overlays data capture architecture (ODCA): Conceived by Paul Knowles, Innovation &amp; Emerging Technology lead at Deductive, this innovative architecture represents schema as multi-dimensional objects consisting of generic schema bases and linked overlays. Primarily devised for data object interoperability and privacy compliant data sharing, this architecture can significantly enhance our ability to pool data between organizations and teams more efficiently. The separation between schema bases and overlays means multiple parties can use the same base objects for similar data capture requirements thus providing a standard from which to decentralize data.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>Self-sovereign identity (SSI): Self-sovereignty is the concept of individuals, organizations, and things having sole ownership of their digital and physical profile, and control over how their data is shared and used. Deductive is one of the founding stewards of the Sovrin Network, an open source project creating a global public utility for SSI. We believe in the ethical use of personal data and see the Sovrin Network as a viable framework to accomplish this goal and to apply it globally. Our continued allegiance to both the Sovrin Foundation and Hyperledger Indy, a distributed ledger, purpose-built for decentralized identity, places us at the cutting edge of identity and access management solutions.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>Blinding Identity Taxonomy (BIT): The BIT includes 46 different PII elements that could un-blind the identity of a person, an organization, or a thing. Identifying all PII elements is one of those critical pieces of behind-the-scenes plumbing that is expected to fundamentally improve data protection of personal data as deployment rates in both traditional and SSI domains rise. Although initially developed in-house, the BIT now resides with Kantara Initiative, a non-profit industry consortium and professional trade association dedicated to advancing technical and legal innovation and trust framework operations related to digital identity management and data privacy.

But there is a lot <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://learn.g2.com/predictive-analytics\">more that companies can achieve through predictive analytics</a> than simply predicting demand for products and services in the coming months. In this blog post, we’re going to walk through a few other use cases for predictive analytics.</p>\n\n<p>Our data science consulting team have lots of experience at building predictive analytic models that don\'t require other third-party products or algorithms to function smoothly and effortlessly for our customers, using either AWS or open-source technology. We mostly work with companies who already have their own in-house data science team and, in our experience, it is this combination of an in-house team with an external team like Deductive that provides the best solutions in terms of both cost-efficiency and time-to-market.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"customer-engagement\">Customer engagement</h2>\n\n<p>Customer engagement involves getting to know as much as you can about your customers while ensuring that the data you gather about them has a clear and documentable business value. As you get to know your customers\' desires and preferences, it becomes easier to acquire new ones, retain the ones you already have (rather than losing them as they switch to your rivals), upsell them your premium services and target them for those particular ads to which they will best respond. </p>\n\n<p>The real goal is to be able to predict the future behavior of the customers. Perhaps your executives have to choose between commissioning a new season for one of two programs while also deciding which two of three new shows to broadcast. The job of the data science team is to present these teams with reports which, by making predictions about future customer behavior, give a helping hand to the executives who will make the actual decisions.</p>\n\n<p>The place to start is by analyzing past consumer behavior while remembering that consumers and their tastes evolve with time, and trying to understand what these changes might be. Someone who loves sport is unlikely to switch to suddenly wanting to watch comedies when their viewing history shows no interest in humor, but they might well be interested in a new car show the company has lined up, or Premier League soccer. Meanwhile, the person who does love anything humorous is worth upselling recently released box office comedies on TVoD. The trick is to find the content that consumers will respond well to, engaging with their viewing desires and preferences, and getting the right, personalized offer to them at the right time.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"predictive-advertising\">Predictive advertising</h2>\n\n<p>It sounds like a buzzword (and, well, it is), but predictive analytics in TV advertising can mean lots of things. Some of it is about where to find an audience - what shows are an audience or segment most likely to watch, and where are they likeliest to over-index? We can gain some of this insight by merely analyzing the data, but predictive analytics can unearth patterns that humans may not be able to find.</p>\n\n<p>One of the unintended consequences of GDPR is also about using predictive analytics to audience segments. You may have a small pool of opted-in users who have opted to share their data with you. TV companies are starting to use predictive analytics to understand which other customers in their database that have not chosen to share data share similar properties with the customers that have. We think this kind of probabilistic matching and segment creation will become more prevalent when a more deterministic solution to matching is not available.</p>\n\n<p>There is nothing inherently new in the concept of predictive advertising, albeit the ways to predict how consumers will respond to ads has changed, and is based on analyzing what the data says (and having a wider range of data points to which to match the TV data). So it is worth targeting an ad for a new expensive Ford model at fans of Top Gear America more than at individuals who have never watched any car-based shows. It isn\'t that the latter group are unlikely to buy a car, but they are unlikely to be as brand sensitive and are less likely to buy an expensive model than the fans of car-themed shows. The team should include any data that can help gain insight into how customers are likely to respond to commercials, as this has clear business value.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"operational-efficiency\">Operational efficiency</h2>\n\n<p>Predictive analytics can also help to drive operational efficiency. Sometimes this is very pragmatic. Can we use predictive analytics to understand what bandwidth costs are going to look like in the next five years, and how to provision networks to take advantage of that? Sometimes, a company knows that there are areas that it can improve on operationally, and analytics can most help by identifying what the cost savings are, and how to implement them. The most compelling opportunities are areas that the company don’t know about. Here, a data mining exercise on some of a business’s operational processes can reveal patterns indicating areas of improvement that the company did not even know about.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 10, 19);

With Internet-of-things sensors also becoming widespread, we don\'t see any let-up in the connected car hype in 2019.</p>\n\n<p>While the holy grail of connected car manufacturers is to create a driverless experience, we don\'t expect that to become a mainstream reality until the next decade, but connected cars are already a reality. The main focus of connected cars is creating a great customer experience, unsurprisingly given manufacturers are the ones designing and building these cars, and focussing on the customer is the best way for them to sell this new product of connectivity. Given that the average American spends 10% of their waking life in a car, a great customer experience will become a powerful selling point.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"innovation-and-the-connected-car-customer-experience\">Innovation and the connected car customer experience</h2>\n\n<p>OEMs are implementing a range of data-powered services in their connected cars, which we can broadly divide into V2V, where vehicles connect with each other, and V2I, where they connect to Internet-of-things infrastructures, such as sensors in traffic lights, street lamps, road markings and gas pumps.</p>\n\n<p>Some of these innovations are merely about taking services we enjoy outside the car, into the car - e.g., allowing Spotify to stream directly into the car speakers. Others take this further, such as voice recognition technology that drivers can use to flick between tracks without taking their eyes off the road, but are still cut from the same cloth and are not really \"new\" ideas.</p>\n\n<p>We think the most attractive innovations are those drivers can use to get from A to B swiftly and with minimal hassle. We are all used to watching ads where a driver takes their new car for a spin along empty city roads, projecting a dream that sadly doesn\'t fit in with the reality of congested roads. Indeed the average American spends 38 hours a year not moving in a traffic jam, which is not merely frustrating but also uses unnecessary gas and pumps out vast amounts of pollutants. If drivers could get where they want to get without being impeded by other vehicles with which they share the road, this would make a real difference.</p>\n\n<p>Other innovations to lessen the impact of traffic jams include a smart GPS, which can indicate the best route from A to B to take right now, based on the latest traffic congestion reports, which in itself will reduce traffic delays by siphoning the connected cars away from the jam. Smart traffic lights for when a car is approaching a red light and, if the other way is clear, can switch to green, are another innovation which works best when the car and the traffic light can communicate with each other. Warning a car that a tire needs changing urgently and thus avoiding a blow-out which will likely cause a crash and delays, as well as potentially saving lives, is a more critical example of connected car innovation keeping the traffic flowing and thus improving the customer experience. Gas pumps that can automatically charge the customer by using the wifi connection and insurance companies offering reduced rates based on the big data they have about the acquired customer driving patterns are other innovations as is the concept of a software update as an alternative to taking the car into the garage to be upgraded or just serviced.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-key-is-in-the-data\">The key is in the data</h2>\n\n<p>Not only will all the connected cars offerings require huge amounts of data processing, but much of this will be necessary for real-time to yield the full benefits. This is one of many challenges facing data engineering and science teams when they set out to start managing connected car datasets (and is the reason that edge computing - processing connected car data on the edge of the network - the vehicle - and sending what is most pertinent to the cloud (e.g. when there has been an alert).</p>\n\n<p>Many of our blog posts are about the media sector, but a lot of the issues and topics we discuss also apply to the car sector. As we have explored elsewhere, data scientists typically spend at least 75% of their working lives cleansing and validating data and integrating disparate data sets. So any data science team working on a connected car dataset needs to address the data quality they have and will have as new data enters the system, which it will do every time someone drives one of the connected cars, i.e., continuously. They should make decisions about how often this data needs to be sent in real-time and the business case for real-time. They need to work with the data governance team to understand which data sets are sensitive, which should be pseudonymized, and how it should be stored so that the business can make the most significant use of it.</p>\n\n<p>Then there\'s the ultimate universal truth. In our experience, there is nothing more important than getting the data quality right in the first place. All the connected car processes will seize up with poor quality data but, once the data quality is right, the data science team can then focus on other tasks which will add business value to the connected car by creating a great customer experience.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 14, 9);

If X&gt;Y, and if X represented a more attractive demographic to advertisers (e.g., young men) than Y the company would charge more for a commercial in the ad break in Show A than Show B. Or so the logic goes.</p>\n\n<p>With advanced TV advertising, panel data is now only one among many datasets, which as a whole reveal more about who is watching a commercial and to what extent those watching it end up clicking through to a product website, order a sample or buy the product (this is known as TV attribution - more on this later)</p>\n\n<p>These sellers of advertising space are also using addressable television to target particular ads at particular households when the technology allows, such as in an OTT service, a smart TV or via a set-top-box device. So a sports-mad household can be targeted with sportswear where a family with young kids might be targetted with ads for diapers, while both households are watching the same comedy.</p>\n\n<p>Such is the promise of advanced advertising. But when we work with companies trying to carry out advanced TV advertising campaigns, we see often see them come unstuck around a couple of key areas: data quality, and accurate attribution. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"youre-only-as-good-as-your-data\">You’re only as good as your data</h2>\n\n<p>The key to all advanced advertising is both having accurate data, and knowing how to use it. Without both, your advanced advertising efforts may come unstuck. Here’s a simple example to demonstrate the point. Let’s take our theoretical household from the start of this post. If we know that the household is a family with young kids, but that the mother is also sports-mad, the reality of how to target this household is complicated. Skillful data scientists can attempt to understand individual viewers by reporting and modeling the data to create an individual viewer model (to understand who is watching the show within a household beyond the device level) to try and solve this. So can data from brokers like Experian, <a href=\"/case-studies/scoring-data-quality/\">although as we have warned before</a> third-party data sets can have issues of their own.</p>\n\n<p>But TV here is inherently at a disadvantage vs. Google et al., where the fact that people are logged in to a computer and/or using a personal mobile makes it much easier to identify the individual exposed to the ad.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"challenges-in-attribution\">Challenges in attribution</h2>\n\n<p>Attribution makes it way more complicated; advertisers on digitial only pay for clicks or actions, such as a user buying content after clicking through to an ad. TV is starting to get into this act, too, but typically TV advertisers still pay for impressions. Advanced advertising doesn\'t merely mean using data to improve targeting. We can also use it to measure, as precisely as possible, the ROI of money spent on advertising - .e.g, has someone who watched an ad clicked through to a website, ordered a sample or even bought a product.</p>\n\n<p>Facebook and Google have used their walled gardens of data to attribute to devastating effect, helping create what is essentially a duopoly in online advertising, and TV companies have started to take notice and act. Much of our work with customers is focused on making the TV experience more similar to digital, helping to use data to make the TV more targetable, more addressable, more accountable, and outcomes better attributed to activity. This can include measuring addressable TV and bringing online segmentation models and techniques to advanced advertising. </p>\n\n<p>But attribution from a television ad needs data you can match. Counting the number of new users who accessed the site within an hour of the ad appearing isn\'t very reliable, mainly as not everyone uses other devices while watching TV. Perhaps I saw an ad for a pair of sneakers yesterday, and my subconscious has been wanting them ever since, but I only go to the site today. TVs also works, as an ad medium, by repetition. Perhaps after six weeks of seeing an ad for a brand of washing powder I have never used, I decided to try it instead of my regular brand. One or two ads from this new for me washing powder may not have changed my mind at all, but an accumulation of commercials banging on about this brilliant new washing powder may well work. This branding power, after all, is what TV advertising has been built on over the years, and will continue to do even as it becomes more measurable and attributable.</p>\n\n<p>These are but some of the challenges that advanced TV advertising faces, but we remain very bullish about the future of TV advertising, as it starts to integrate some of these new elements into what has always made it a great medium. </p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 15, 8);
INSERT INTO `aldryn_newsblog_article_translation` VALUES (17, 'en', 'When you need data engineers, not data scientists', 'when-you-need-data-engineers', '<p>Data science has become a real buzzword over the last few years. Everybody wants to be a data scientist, resulting in phenomena such as data science boot camps. Yet ten years ago there was no \"data science,\" even though a lot of the tasks data scientists carry out today were certainly carried out ten years\' ago, albeit with smaller datasets than those used today.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps, in another ten years, data science will be called something else, although the general principles probably won\'t change much; using mathematics and statistical models to maximize the value of data.</p>\n\n<p>Data engineering, however, is a more recent concept which people are less likely to have heard of, or, if they do know of it, may assume it is just a branch of data science. However, data engineers are every bit as important as data scientists in a successful analytics strategy. Companies should consider the statistic that for every data scientist it employs, it will need at least two and possibly as many as five data engineers, meaning it is essential to recruit not just the right data scientists, but the right engineers. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-data-engineering\">What is data engineering?</h2>\n\n<p>Think of data engineers as being the foundations of a pyramid. If data scientists need to carry out work to help a company to meet its KPIs or achieve its goals and ambitions, data engineers build the structure that the data scientists require to do that work.</p>\n\n<p>If the goal is data mining the data the company has to feed predictive analytics, the engineers build the structures needed so the data scientists can complete this task. Data scientists do not want to have to build a data lake or data warehouse, even using available products such as Amazon\'s Athena and Redshift or platforms such as Oracle Exadata or open-source data repositories such as Hadoop and Hive, as this is a job for data engineers (see our article on choosing a database). The scientists want the database built and ready-for-use so they can build the models needed to help drive a business forward.</p>\n\n<p>A data engineer is typically a software engineer who ideally already has some experience in working within distributed systems, though this experience can always be gained on-the-job if the candidates are competent. Once they have built the infrastructure for the data scientists to use, the engineers are also responsible for maintaining it, along with a data operations team. Typically, the initial structure, which may have met requirements initially, may have to be modified as the data science team face unexpected problems or issues or as the business team makes new requests.</p>\n\n<p>The main areas where data engineers work include ensuring data quality by avoiding formatting and rogue data issues and thus ensuring that the data has the resilience to function smoothly. Scalability and security are other commons tasks for the data engineering team. It may be that changes in the company, such as a growth spurt in people or customers, drives a need for up-scaling across all departments, including analytics. The structures which the data engineers created should have been built with scalability in mind, so part of this task is not just scaling, but doing so in a non-disruptive manner for the rest of the business</p>\n\n<p>Security involves initially identifying which datasets are subject to the highest levels of scrutiny (such as PII) and ensuring the structures are in place so that relevant data gets extra levels of security and that PII data is properly pseudonymized. While the pseudonymization is a data science task, the data engineering team needs to create the infrastructure the company uses to house the pseudonymized data, along with all relevant permissions.</p>\n\n<p>The fundamental task, however, is first creating and then maintaining the data pipeline. This undertaking is not so easy given that a typical modern data pipeline which processes large amounts of data on a daily basis may require dozens of different technologies to function properly. A well-designed data pipeline allows a company to do what it wants with the data it has, such as maintaining a complex, rapidly changing website, as well as giving access to the analytics, reporting and other essential feeds that are required by people within the organization. This is why data engineers are so important. Their work provides the foundations on which everything else, analytics-wise, is built.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 17, 13);

There are a lot of examples of the latter. We\'ve all been there. Like anything in life, data science is something we get better at via practice and trial and error - and the entire concept of data science is that we test things repeatedly, including multiple things that fail, until we get it right.</p>\n\n<p>So as an antidote to believing too much in popular memes and boot camp thinking about the magical power of machine learning, we thought we\'d look at some of the reasons we have seen machine learning projects fail - and more importantly, how we can learn from them</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-machine-learning-fails\">Why machine learning fails</h2>\n\n<p>Our data science consulting team think there are two broad types of machine learning failures: those your data science team are aware of, and those which they aren\'t. The former is part and parcel of the machine learning process, and of the learning process of the data science team in charge of the machine learning. The latter can be much more severe.</p>\n\n<p>When you test your model, and it has not worked, you should (hopefully) be able to learn what has gone wrong - with either your model, or the data, or the questions you are asking. At any rate, you know that there are problems, and can begin the task of fixing them. Whereas if everything appears to be performing fine, a team will go on making the same mistakes, your machine learning will be flawed, and your model won\'t do what you want it to do.</p>\n\n<p>In short, there are dozens of reasons projects can fail. Sometimes it starts at the very beginning - by not prioritizing the right business questions. The differences between a good and bad question can be subtle. \"I want to improve retention\" and \"My churn is on the rise, and I need to stop it\" are similar statements - but one is more reactive than the other, and approaching this same problem from these two different start points will result in two entirely different models.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes it\'s about the data science team asking the right questions. Unfortunately, a lot of data science boot camps, while excellent at showing students how to proceed once a question has been asked, fail when it comes to teaching how to ask the right questions.</p>\n\n<p>Very similar to asking the wrong question is trying to use machine learning to solve the wrong problems. The typical reason for this is not focussing on business values. Unless the problem you are trying to solve has an obvious value to the business, it is almost certainly going to be a waste of time and energy. Let\'s look at retention as an example again. If companies only have a limited retention budget each year, they should focus a model on retaining higher ARPU subscribers, rather than necessarily trying to retain lots of subscribers. Some of these customers may either by lower ARPU subscribers, or subscribers that are fundamentally disloyal (e.g. people who subscribe for a sweetener deal, and then unsubscribe when that deal expires). Focusing on trying to save the highest number of customers, rather than the best customers, is a classic example of a team addressing a problem in a way that looks sensible, but that doesn\'t solve the issue as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ve seen plenty of examples of data science teams using the wrong tool or technology to solve a problem. Neural networks are a classic example of this - they\'re de rigeur for data science teams today, but they don\'t fix everything. They don\'t work well for subscriber analytics projects, because the business is interested in the inputs for the model (why is subscriber X rated as more likely to churn than subscriber Y, and what does this say about our retention strategy and customer base overall?)</p>\n\n<p>But the most common mistake of all? You guessed it - bad data. Either there is not enough data, too much data (overfitting at the modeling stage by modeling on the entire base), the wrong data, or data of such poor quality that it is unusable. The real issue with dirty data is that it may produce reasonable-looking results, and it might be months or years until someone realizes that something is wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Machine learning may look like it can produce \"magical\" results, but its the much less magical good quality data pipeline that is the basis for any successful model. You need to be confident the data have data quality before testing the models only high-quality data will let you know if the model actually works.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 19, 1);

This figure should come as a surprise to nobody given both the frequency of scandals concerning data breaches of PII data which had not been <a href=\"/blogs/data-science-gdpr-pseudonymization-data-pipeline/\">anonymized or pseudonymized</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The report divided all consumers into three groups:</p>\n\n<p>• <strong>Relaxed consumers</strong>, who are not concerned that they don\'t have control over their data, trust the companies who store their data and believe that the law effectively protects their rights to privacy.</p>\n\n<p>• <strong>Fundamentalists</strong>, who care passionately about their data and don\'t trust companies to look after it.</p>\n\n<p>• <strong>Pragmatists</strong>, who are defined as those that don\'t fit into either of the first two categories.</p>\n\n<p>The report raises the fact that the proportion of consumers who say they will opt-in to their data being used for different purposes is not entirely as black and white as the definition of these buckets of users. 70% of relaxed consumers, 65% of data pragmatists and 35% of data fundamentalists, respectively, say they would consent to companies using their personal data for marketing.</p>\n\n<p>An obvious conclusion to draw is that 70% is a low opt-in rate for consumers who apparently don’t much care about how marketers use their data and that 35% is pretty high for those that do. What this actually really shows is that consumers are much more discerning about which companies they will let use their data, and which they won\'t.</p>\n\n<p>We think companies should consider GDPR as an opportunity to restore faith in consumers whose data they hold. This means building greater awareness of all the data assets they have, or where they store their PII data, and what strategies they have in place to protect the privacy of their customers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"improving-opt-in-rates-for-tv-data\">Improving opt-in rates for TV data</h2>\n\n<p>What can companies do to improve their reputation when it comes to enhancing opt-in rates for GDPR? An excellent place to start is assessing all the data they have, including new datasets, and how they will use each field. How much of the data is really necessary to be collected and processed in this way? Especially when it comes to PII data, we strongly recommend a minimalist approach, expressed in the opt-in clause. And if you are going to take the time and effort to pseudonymize PII data, let your customers know that you are doing this. Many consumers won\'t care, but data fundamentalists may do.</p>\n\n<p>Explain how the customer will benefit from ticking the marketing opt-in box. Most of us can get irritated at marketing and advertising which appears completely irrelevant. If a customer opts out of their data being used, it doesn\'t mean they won\'t be on the receiving end of such a campaign, merely that it won\'t be personalized. Companies letting your customers know what the benefits are of opting-in to a personalized campaign can only help in driving opt-in.</p>\n\n<p>And maybe the best way to let customers know about the enormous efforts you are making to protect their data and your strategies for preventing data breaches is by changing the language you use when explaining opt-in, with improved language expression leading to <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://medium.com/@forward_action/gdpr-how-changing-your-opt-in-language-can-increase-consent-rate-by-50-f9cffe1f6f22\">a 50% increase in opt-in rates</a> in some studies. Many companies are reluctant to spread the word about their efforts in this area, perhaps fearing that any mention of data security here will make their customers nervous and less likely to opt-in. We’d argue that explaining directly, or linking to an explanation outlining their efforts in guaranteeing the safety of PII data being held by them, is better than saying nothing. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sMKyScs3uo\">And we’ve seen this first hand with our partner Inscape – who have ably demonstrated that clear and unambiguous language at opt-in can boost rates for their Smart TV data services</a></p>\n\n<p>In other words – give consumers the ability to be discerning about what they will or won’t let you do with their data.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 20, 11);

It\'s thus a great asset for any customer-centred business as a company to have what our data science consulting team describe as joined-up data.</p>\n\n<p>Most datasets are stored and then used for reporting and modeling for specific purposes, such as CRM, subscription services or datasets from apps. Joining up these datasets by creating a single customer view makes this data more potent and useful for any company, especially regarding driving KPIs and executing core business goals and strategies. Given the ferocious competition in the TV industry since Netflix and the OTT model broke the mold, we at Deductive state unequivocally that those companies who use TV data to know the most about their customers, powered partly by a single customer view, will emerge as the winners.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-a-single-customer-view\">Benefits of a single customer view</h2>\n\n<p>Our data science consulting team has identified several specific business and marketing benefits to having a single customer view. These benefits begin with a more thorough and complete understanding of customers, which will then facilitate improved business planning and product development. The company can then share these better insights it has into customer behavior with advertisers. Both the business itself and the data which flows through it will become more efficient, especially concerning avoiding waste and misguided efforts.</p>\n\n<p>The marketing benefits begin with insights, both detailed and comprehensive, into each customer. Assuming there is a large enough pool of customers, these insights will help customer acquisition too. However, a single customer view also has great value when it comes to organizing your marketing campaign across multiple platforms in a logical sequence. Perhaps a customer began using your website but now uses your Facebook page or a third-party app or simply a different device to access your website. What is important is the customer and not the platform they are using, and a customer who regularly switches between the platforms you offer should get the same smooth and uninterrupted marketing experience as someone who stays on the website, and this is much easier to achieve with a single customer view.</p>\n\n<p>A single customer view also allows the company to offer a personalized marketing experience to each customer. This experience includes making the customer\'s journey as easy and interesting as possible by using the single customer view to tailor the marketing experience to individuals. Customers have many ways of conveying their needs and desires to a company if the company are willing to listen. If a male customer clearly dislikes sport but is still being treated as a sports fan - because, using demographic logic, all men like sport, right? - the company may be about to lose a customer. Perhaps the customer is actually fascinated by historical documentaries, as revealed by his viewing behavior, and will respond well to a marketing campaign full of details of all the historical documentaries the company are going to broadcast this winter. For us, the critical factor is that a customer should only have to reveal their preferences and how they want to engage with the companies and services once.</p>\n\n<p>A single customer view is also known as a customer real-time propensity model. In propensity modeling, past behavior is used to predict likely future behavior by using machine learning. This can help create a great user experience, including recommendations, i.e., if you liked that, you\'ll probably like this too. Propensity modeling can also help to retain customers by spotting and then minimizing churn as well as trying to persuade the customer to make decisions which will be profitable for the business.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-build-a-single-customer-view\">How to build a single customer view</h2>\n\n<p>Each customer needs a unique identifier which is used to identify them across all the databases and data collection points which the company has. If you don\'t have a separate, primary email address for each customer, deciding which identifier (or match fabric) to use can be tricky. An IP address is both unstable (some IP addresses change frequently) and would tie the customer into a particular location while cookies would tie a customer into a specific device. These identifiers may have worked a few years ago but not in 2018. At Deductive, our data strategy consultants encourage companies to make customers register to access their services; this is now so normal that they will lose few if any customers by making this demand.</p>\n\n<p>There are many issues to be considered when building a single customer view. When and where will you be using the single customer view? How do you prioritize among the various data feeds you have about your customer, i.e., all the info will be on one page but which data comes first and which goes to the bottom? Are there any third-party sources you could be including but aren\'t? Are you updating your data sources? How long before a piece of data becomes out-dated? Is the quality of the existing data sufficient? Can it be improved? Asking these questions is essential for the data science team who are going to build a single customer view.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"data-matching-and-single-customer-views\">Data matching and single customer views</h2>\n\n<p>At the heart of creating a single customer view for each and every customer is data matching. At it\'s simplest, if there are two datasets and one has my email address and the other my television preferences, based on my previous television watching habits, then matching is linking these bits of data as about the same customer. While deterministic matching is by definition accurate, there is also probabilistic matching where two records are likely to match. In this post-GDPR world, arguably the most important thing to get right in data matching across multiple datasets is the privacy of any personally identifiable information, which your company can do through anonymization or pseudonymization.</p>\n\n<p>Data matching is useful both to help companies learn more about their customers and to make ad inventory more valuable, e.g., if one dataset contains a list of email addresses on a mailing list and a second dataset which includes those customers who use one of the company\'s subscription-based apps. Data matching these two datasets might help sell ads to particular users if the app contains an advertising element. Data matching can also be combined with segmentation, i.e., selling to people based on segments rather than demographics. Acxiom and Experian are examples of information service provider companies which have built up large databases of users where they characterize the users with literally hundreds of behavioral segments based on purchasing habits and more general attitudes.</p>\n\n<p>Collapse </p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 26, 8);

Ratings forecasting has been a bedrock of TV advertising sales for decades. As the volume and variety of data in the TV industry increases, so does demand forecasting. But what is it, and why is it important?</p>\n\n<p>Simply put, demand forecasting measures past demand to predict future demand. So, if the demand for cars has risen and for motorbikes has fallen this year, demand forecasting would indicate that it is sensible to increase car production and decrease motorcycle production right now to change the supply available next spring.</p>\n\n<p>Sounds simple. However, if this demand forecast had occurred in the fall of 1968, it would have been entirely wrong. The spectacular success the following year of the motorcycle-themed movie <em>Easy Rider,</em> which popularized, and created an unexpected surge in demand for, motorcycles, causing issues in the supply chain. This sudden surge illustrates why demand forecasting is so vulnerable to unforeseen changes between the moment you decide to make the product and the moment where the product is ready to be sold.</p>\n\n<p>Today, the solution to predicting difficult-to-predict surges has shifted from research to mining big data sets to predictive analytics that tries to answer the challenging questions of demand forecasting in a report, which decision-makers then require immediately before making those important decisions which cannot then easily be changed a few months down the line.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"forecasting-demand-for-television\">Forecasting demand for television</h2>\n\n<p>In the television industry, decision-making might be when a broadcaster commits to buying a comedy series, chooses to invest more in live sports events next year, which shows to broadcast or release and when to do so, as well as critically important decisions about inventory pricing. Our data science consulting team carry out demand forecasting projects to help decision-makers answer these questions. So how do data scientists deal with the problem of demand forecasting for the TV industry?</p>\n\n<p>Demand forecasting focusses on all the material being broadcast, ordering shows by popularity and genre, based primarily but not entirely on past audience ratings because audience tastes change over time. Nielsen traditionally dominated these ratings, but nowadays a lot of new data sets are being added into the mix, such as smart TV data and set-top-box data.</p>\n\n<p>However, the goal is not merely to have a comprehensive view of what customers did last spring but to understand what consumer demand is likely to be next spring. If a broadcaster can get a more accurate picture of likely consumer demand in the coming year, this will help them acquire more customers, whereas if they neglect to do so, they will likely lose customers. TV broadcasters want to offer a service that the highest number of customers will be attracted to,</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"implementing-demand-forecasting-that-works\">Implementing demand forecasting that works</h2>\n\n<p>The first task for demand forecasting is deciding which data sets are worth including. We always counsel a minimization approach where each data set which you add needs to be justified in its inclusion. However, because predicting future demand is very difficult, innovative use of data which give a clearer picture of what next spring\'s demand looks like can have great value. The important thing is to have a process in place where the inclusion of any data set for the forecasting projects needs to be justified based on its business value.</p>\n\n<p>With your datasets chosen the next step is to prepare the data. It is almost certain that most of the data sets you have will have multiple uses, of which demand forecasting is only one. As long as you have a strict policy about preparing data as it enters your data lake or data warehouse or platforms, this will ensure that all your demand forecasting data have been adequately validated, cleansed and integrated and have the quality that means they are always up to the new task or the model. You can either get your data engineering team to build a pipeline and get your data science consulting team to prepare their data or use an off-the-shelf product (like the Deductive Pipeline API), to do so.</p>\n\n<p>As with any predictive analytics, asking the right questions of the data will make a big difference to the final results. This questioning begins by documenting a definition of the problem, i.e., the specific requirements of forecasting consumer demand in any particular case. The range of choices open to the decision-makers, such as whether to invest more in live baseball or to instead buy a promising drama, need to be documented, as specific questions that require precise, defined answers.</p>\n\n<p>The specific needs of the business should be the basis of the questions you are asking. Is there enough consumer demand to justify bidding for live motor racing coverage? Should we be offering more hours of reality dating shows? These are the kinds of questions you might be asking of the data. The trick is to extract the relevant data you have about consumer demand for these particular genres by asking specific questions and modelling how they are answered from a technical viewpoint.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"drawing-a-bigger-picture\">Drawing a bigger picture</h3>\n\n<p>Some companies will have data going back years, and this can be very useful in drawing a picture of customer demand. For instance, were there any factors which predicted the rise of the reality TV genre? Or its child, the dating reality TV genre? Given the importance of genre for classifying the kinds of shows people will watch, to be able to predict new popular genres can give production companies an edge. Of course, the reality TV genre began in 1997 in Holland with Big Brother and then took the US (and the UK) by storm, but only three years later. Let\'s imagine some new kind of drama sub-genre is unknowingly about to be launched this fall due to the runaway success of a new drama show which is as big a smash hit as Breaking Bad was in its heyday. As one of your competitors will produce the show, your current demand forecasting cannot factor anything about the new show. But in six months time, when you do the next round of demand forecasting, if your data and their predictive analytics are top quality, and include the runaway success of this new show, your demand forecasting should indicate that the possibilities for this new type of genre are enormous and well worth investing in, perhaps before your other rivals do.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have set in motion a data science approach to demand forecasting it is then important to see how well it worked. So now would be a good time to see how the demand forecast for Q2 this year, created last fall, fitted with the \"reality\" of Q2, with said \"reality\" being datasets about actual consumer behavior, in so far as you can ascertain this. Comparing forecasts with real information may then assist in getting better initial data sets and asking better questions in the next round of demand forecasting.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 27, 8);

Short-term measurements which companies typically use to measure their success on a quarterly basis (profitability, share price, revenue, sales) can be affected by seasonal variations. For example – a spike in the number of visitors to your OTT app last month might get your TV analytics team excited - but if that spike is driven by the latest popular drama also starting last month, the company cannot judge how well they are doing based on one show.</p>\n\n<p>CLV can be a tremendous long-term planning tool, that helps to reveal light on the long-term performance of the business. It can also help to understand overall performance that cuts across multiple business units, revenue lines, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>There are some obvious structural reasons within the TV industry as to why CLV is essential. Ad-created content is free and increasingly shareable; most subscription services have generous free trial periods and opt-in/opt-out arrangements that encourage a fluid sign-up and drop-out period. Just because someone is watching your service now, it doesn’t automatically mean they will continue to do so; there is no lock-in as with more traditional TV services. This fluidity of customer movement between services means providers must work extra hard not just to keep those customers, but to understand how valuable those customers are</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"focusing-tv-analytics-on-the-customer\">Focusing TV analytics on the customer</h2>\n\n<p>By focusing on the customer, and measuring their behavior over the time they are likely to spend with the business, it becomes easier to avoid vanity metrics and short-term trends while instead focusing on the long-term health and profitability of the company.</p>\n\n<p>There are broadly two ways of approaching the challenge of calculating a CLV:</p>\n\n<p>Static/exploratory approach: This is an excellent first step towards creating a customer lifetime value model. The static approach takes specific static data inputs and calculates a historic score by making certain basic assumptions: based on how much revenue a customer has generated, how long they have stayed a subscriber to the company’s services, pricing trends, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Predictive approach: This takes CLV a step further by using machine learning and predictive analytics to create a more detailed approach which doesn\'t just create a historical value but also tries to predict future values, by understanding how variables will change over time. Including these forecasted values in reporting and modeling can reveal what is coming around the corner.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"best-practice\">Best Practice</h2>\n\n<p>Our data science consulting team have identified four factors which can make a real difference when calculating a CLV score:</p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>\n	<p>Getting the right data and the right metrics, which includes avoiding vanity metrics and broad metrics, which can be deceptive and produce a CLV model which could hinder rather than help the business. Data science teams need to work at understanding what accurately define success and failure. It probably isn’t, for example, the number of people who download your app, which is a classic vanity metric that doesn’t really tell a business much except how successful its launch strategy was. It’s more likely to be something like users it acquires each month, cost of acquisition, loyalty scores, and so on.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>Maximize relevant data feeds: We advise our clients to maximize the number of relevant data feeds in when developing a CLV model. This doesn\'t contradict our basic rule that data storage should be kept to a minimum but it does mean that the data science team needs to justify every input, as undoubtedly more pertinent data will help create a more accurate CLV model. As long as the data is relevant and clean, we have found that more tends to be better.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>Keep it fluid: A CLV model should not be a one-time deployment, but an evolving project. Metrics can change swiftly. Assumptions can be both proved and disproved. It is imperative to revisit your model and check that the inputs and assumptions you made are still relevant. How often a team should make these checks varies from business to business as it is a matter of balancing the cost of re-assessing the CLV compared to the financial gain from an updated CLV score. Checking the CLV every day is unlikely to be worth doing but leaving it a year is likely too long. We recommend re-doing the CLV every three months as a starting point.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p>Picking the right formula: There are lots of ways to calculate CLV, with no real “right” answer. Most formulae will use a combination of subscription revenue, churn rate and rate of new customer acquisition. Including profit margin and cost of acquisition provides a more rigorous picture, as does applying a discount rate to future revenues. Other CLV metrics might include the rate at which people buy content; seasonal factors; content costs, and so on. We usually recommend a hybrid approach to CLV modeling, using a composite of several methods to come up with the most rigorous final value.</p>\n	</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Talk to our data <a href=\"https://hello@deductive.com\">science consulting team</a> to talk about how we have helped media companies define their CLV models.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 29, 1);

But in the maelstrom of new TV ad-related technology, data, products and services, brands and advertisers can sometimes get lost in the mix. This is, of course, imprudent, because brands and advertisers are the ones funding this market, and any market needs buyers and sellers to be satisfied to be functioning. We will only realize this vision of data-driven TV if advertisers buy into all of the innovations the sell side is providing.</p>\n\n<p>So what do advertisers want from advanced TV advertising? At Deductive we talk a lot about how we help buyers and sellers to make their TV advertising more like digital, by making it more measurable and targetable. This is definitely part of the answer about what buyers want, but not the whole answer. We think the buy- and sell-side want TV to be more like digital in different ways; in some ways, the sell side doesn\'t want TV to be more like digital at all.</p>\n\n<p>Take pricing. Targeting a smaller or niche audience on TV that has interacted with your brand, or is interested in your product, is a no-brainer, but the sell-side will place a premium on this. Inevitably there will be a coming together on where this premium should be set, but this is really a data question, as well as a pricing question. If the buy-side can find dayparts or networks that over-index against their target audience that they can buy addressably, but that would have been traditionally priced low, they are going to want to pay based on what the seller thinks the inventory is worth, not what it is worth to them. This is definitely one area where buyers would much rather TV was like digital, which has seen a race to the bottom, price-wise, over the past decade, than buyers.</p>\n\n<p>Measurability is another touchpoint. When a customer sees an ad from a brand on Facebook, they will have a very different user experience than they will from watching Television. TV companies have argued that it is easy to miss Facebook or other digital ads as they don\'t dominate the screen, whereas Television ads do, and the continued bull case for TV advertising is that if 5 million people were exposed to an ad, then 5 million people saw the ad.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, this is not always true – some people will be looking at their phones, or have the volume down, or will go out to make coffee or take the garbage out. This kind of activity is picked up by Nielsen, which tracks when viewers leave the room in its people meter markets, but the types of big datasets that are fuelling addressable campaigns do not. For attribution use cases this is less of an issue, but for a branding campaign, buyers are likely to want to know if someone has seen their ad.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"user-experience-but-not-like-that\">User experience - but not like that</h2>\n\n<p>Finally, there\'s user experience - but not in the way you are thinking about. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdE2fd9JFqg\">A study last year of marketers</a> talked about the concept of user experience in media not from a viewer or consumer perspective, but from a marketer perspective.

Marketers know TV works, and they know that if they spend X on it, they will get a return of Y in terms of sales, uplift, brand awareness or whatever KPI they are tracking. But TV is a black box. They know it works, but they don\'t know \"how\" it works, and it contrasts starkly with digital, which is involved from a marketing perspective, and demonstrates its value from planning to evaluation, and at all points in between.</p>\n\n<p>This is something TV needs to get much better at, especially as it starts to move into attribution or outcome-based campaigns. It\'s also a nice reminder that even though more and more buying decisions are algorithmically made, it is still humans that first decide to use those algorithms, and then write them in the first place. Facebook, Google et al have been extremely successful not just on data and technology, but on the non-technical skill of explaining and demonstrating its value to the human beings who make these decisions. TV execs know they have work to do on the first of these areas, but as a generation of marketers raised on social media rise to positions of prominence in buying organizations, they\'re going to have to spend more time on the second of these areas, too.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 32, 5);

More and more sports rights holders are thinking about screening their content directly instead of going through a rights holders selling process, typically by using OTT, although this decision is a complex piece of financial juggling. The number of potential buyers for a sports event (or series of events, such as UK Premier League Soccer) can exceed 200 worldwide, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/media-rights-propel-sports-revenue-2018-11\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">and the fees they receive from rights holders, unlike ratings, are only heading in one direction</a>. But for some rights holders, especially those with a more niche and globally distributed fan base, going OTT might make a lot of sense. Many will look at <a href=\"http://www.wwe.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WWE</a>, with its enviable mix of direct-to-consumer and traditional subscription propositions, as an example of having the best of both worlds.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"will-sport-see-a-netflix-moment\">Will sport see a Netflix moment?</h2>\n\n<p>OTT has already changed the nature of television, as demonstrated particularly by Netflix, which doesn\'t broadcast sport, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/11/20/amazon-bids-us-sports-channels-new-challenge-broadcasters/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">unlike its rival Amazon, which now offers top-tier tennis rights, among other events.</a>. This is a fascinating proposition for multiple reasons. Amazon\'s business model for video is to get enough subscribers to spend enough with the company to make its investment in video and in Prime worthwhile. This is an entirely different proposition financially to its traditional business. The payback calculation is much easier to make with series and movies, some of which you own, than with spiraling sports rights costs.</p>\n\n<p>The key to Amazon (or anyone) making this a success will be to understand what the crossover is between its more core drama and series-binging fans and sports, which is something we\'ve seen in every segmentation project we have done for a Pay TV content. Maximizing sports value is not just about selling Premier League soccer to die-hard Man Utd and Liverpool fans. It\'s about understanding the more casual fanbase, and what the crossover is between their sports habits and what else they watch.</p>\n\n<p>What is particularly intriguing is whether we see a sports-focused Netflix arise. In the UK, Eleven Sports is broadly offering that proposition, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/12/eleven-sports-may-be-facing-closure-in-uk-after-only-four-months\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">and has had a rather inauspicious start to life</a>. But the theory is not dissimilair to the original Netflix business case. Lots of consumers have fragmented interest in sports, beyond the main and obvious ones, and would pay a small subscription fee to be able to consume this content, and to engage with the action. It could certainly be an opportunity for niche sports such as fencing or judo to build greater audiences.</p>\n\n<p>If this business case sounds familiar, its because it is not really new - <a href=\"https://www.eurosportplayer.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Eurosport has been doing something similar to this for years</a>. The more significant opportunity, and one very exciting to us from a data perspective, is for rights holders to use OTT to build a relationship with their fan base. This is especially true when said base is spread thinly across the world, as is the case with fans of drag racing, ice hockey or another sport which has not traditionally been among the most popular sports such as soccer or baseball. The NFL has been particularly good at capitalizing on these new distribution methods to build overseas fan communities, and we think others will start following suit. Here, all of the things we regularly blog about - fan engagement, customer acquisition, retention - come into play.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"its-all-in-the-data\">It\'s all in the data</h2>\n\n<p>Like more general television, sport is full of genres and segments. A fan of baseball might be interested in soccer, and a fan of athletics might be interested in cycling. There are also sub-genres, so a soccer fan might be interested in 5-a-side soccer or women\'s soccer while boxing fans might be interested in judo. While segmenting sports work in the same way as in more mainstream television, we should not assume that it is going to be plain sailing for OTT companies interested in streaming sports events. In OTT generally, user experience has, if not taken over from content as the key to success, certainly become part of the wider conversation about what makes a service successful. It isn\'t enough to merely get the rights for say all the best soccer available and then rake in the profits as die-hard soccer fans and even those who like to watch an occasional game sign up in flocks. What is needed to guarantee success and a good ROI on the cost of obtaining the rights to particular sporting events is to engage with individual customers rather than a whole TV audience, finding out what they like and how they like it, in terms of how they want to consume say Premier League soccer or sumo wrestling. Is an event being live important or not? Does it matter if the viewers can\'t watch the game on their smartphones? Or if they can\'t watch in a foreign country as they travel for work or vacations? These questions have answers, which the company can find in the data they will already have, and by using the data to reach out to and successfully engages with both actual and potential customers.</p>\n\n<p>The first task facing the data science team is to understand sports fans. These fans range from the fanatic who\'ll watch anything to the devotee who\'ll watch any basketball to the fanatic who\'ll watch any game with the Los Angeles Lakers to the niche fan to the occasional watcher who is still willing to fork out money even though she maybe watches 2 or 3 sports events a month. Personalization is a key factor, so all these and many other types of sports fans feel they are being taken account of, and that the service on offer gives them the sport that they enjoy watching when they want to watch it. By focussing on personalization and a data-driven approach using OTT streaming, sports rights holders can push back against the falling ratings for sport and bring sport on TV truly into the 21st Century.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 33, 10);

We wanted to delve into this topic a little more, partly because of what we sometimes see as a misconception about data mining and how it is used.</p>\n\n<p>I\'ve heard data mining described as \"digging for buried treasure\" before and it does sometimes carry an almost romantic notion with it. The concept of looking in large sets of data and looking for hidden patterns in it strikes at the very heart of the promise data science - taking something that appears random or meaningless, and finding value in it. The beauty of data mining is the ability to find said value in left-field places.</p>\n\n<p>To take an example close to our industry -let\'s look again, as we did in our original piece, at archives. Media companies have vast archives of TV shows dating back decades and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsvBOtHRU2c\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">more and more are starting to digitize them</a>. These shows have often been sitting on tapes in a room for decades, waiting for someone to discover and use them. Digitization means that, for the first time, a data science team can write algorithms analyzing this content, and uncovering patterns in the data that we don’t know exists. Could data mining reveal a hitherto-unseen pattern in archive shows that influences content commissioning in the future? We don’t know - but data mining may help us to find an answer.</p>\n\n<p>TV is awash with new consumption data sets – from OTT devices, set-top box providers and Smart TV devices – and the industry is still at the forefront of using them, so there are lots of “known unknowns” waiting to be unearthed via data-mining. More specifically, lots of “unsupervised learning” projects – projects that test data that isn’t labeled or classified in any way – rely heavily on data mining, and lots of the problems we try and solve for our media customers at Deductive require this approach.</p>\n\n<p>Take segment creation or audience clustering. There are of dozens of different ways to cut or look at your audience. Even if you want to create a relatively simple segment - say, people who are heavy viewers of a shorter show - there are multiple different ways to do this (we have written about some of them)[https://deductive.com/building-precision-audiences-tv-data] here. Finding the best method involves mining the data and looking for patterns.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-prosaic-side-of-data-mining\">The prosaic side of data mining</h2>\n\n<p>Data mining is about spotting patterns, but patterns don’t appear by waving on a magic wand. Once a team has looked at a set of data, it needs to validate and cleanse the data - failure to do this can compromise any efforts to find meaningful patterns. Typically, companies spend the bulk of their time preprocessing and conditioning the data to make sure it is clean, consistent, and appropriately combined to deliver business intelligence on which they can rely. Data mining is all about the data and successful data mining requires data that accurately reflects the business.</p>\n\n<p>Data mining is also a more prosaic part of lots of other projects that are not inherently about finding patterns in data. Any supervised learning project - churn prediction, ratings forecasting, or any problem with more defined parameters than an unsupervised project – will start with data mining, so the data science consulting team can understand the parameters of the problem before they think about how best to solve it. </p>\n\n<p>Let’s go back to new data sets – imagine a customer gets hold of a new set of clickstream data that it can use to understand how customers move between different parts of a Smart TV user interface. There are dozens of applications for this set of data – the marketing team can use it to understand how viewers move between different parts of the UI, or the relative effectiveness of different ad slots. But before the marketing team can get to this point, the data engineering team needs to carry out data mining to understand what is actually in the raw data, and to turn it into something useful. This process involves understanding where the data has come from, typically from, how it is constructed and how to find meaning out of it.</p>\n\n<p>All of which goes to demonstrate that data mining is not merely an exciting cherry on top of the data science cake, but something much more foundational to the discipline as a whole.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 34, 1);

As the youngest millennials are now turning twenty-five, so there is a definite need to explore the new generation, widely known as GenZ, and encompassing people born between 1995 and 2010.</p>\n\n<p>These \"generations\" aren\'t simple demographics defined by age right now but by the year of birth. Generational metrics aren\'t looking at what a typical 35-year-old or 55-year-old does, they are looking at how a generation responds over time, and ultimately over a lifetime, and looking at characteristics that fundamentally define the group, and differentiate it from other groups.</p>\n\n<p>Don\'t underestimate the spending power of GenZ, as there are more of them and they have more influence over consumer decisions than any generation before them. Assuming they are just a continuation of millennials is inaccurate, and it is definitely worth getting the data science team to focus on GenZ metrics to engage with this group and market successfully to them. Given that by next year this generation will already be the largest group of consumers worldwide and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.investmentbank.barclays.com/our-insights/generation-z.html\">represent 40% of consumers in the UK and US with $200billion to spend directly and $1trillion indirectly</a>, they are an essential group to understand.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"begining-to-understand-genz\">Begining to understand GenZ</h2>\n\n<p>The first thing a data strategy team working with metrics to help their company to understand and engage with GenZ is to look at defining features in your reporting and modeling, and with an emphasis on marketing goods and services to this generation. GenZ is a group which doesn\'t particularly like ads and tends to be the early adopters of ad-blocking technology, making reaching out to them more challenging than with older groups. However, the generation responds well to ads which have celebrity endorsement and which focus on ethical values. They are also developing a reputation for being financially conservative, as well as favoring a great product (say an iPhone) over a great experience (say a holiday), so it is essential to be seen to be giving them value for their money. </p>\n\n<p>As keen observers of the TV industry we have noted not merely the rise of YouTube but how many entrepreneurial members of GenZ have made successful careers for themselves as influencers using these and other social media platforms such as Instagram as leaders in say the field of beauty products, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/29/meet-the-cleanfluencers-the-online-gurus-who-like-things-nice-and-tidy\">cleaning</a>, exotic travel or other lifestyle choices. This approach is very different from the \"traditional\" method of companies taking the lead in defining what the leading beauty products or vacation destinations are. Influencer marketing identifies the individuals who are likely to have a strong influence over whatever field they are in and either tries to conform their own message to what the influencers are saying or directly get them to endorse their products and services.</p>\n\n<p>GenZ is a generation which has grown up with the Internet available on multiple devices and are social media savvy. Getting noticed on social media and maintaining the presence of the brand is especially important with this generation. It isn\'t that TV ads won\'t work with them, but they won\'t work alone and have to be part of a much broader strategy where the brand itself tries to set trends and become an influencer. Ethical choices are also important, as illustrated by the popularity of veganism among GenZ. Promoting actively moral and authentic behavior, as we saw in <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://gillette.com/en-us/the-best-men-can-be\">Gillette\'s The Best Men Can Be</a> campaign, can be an effective way to get a response from this generation, especially if the ad appears \"edgy\" and the brand appears willing to take risks.</p>\n\n<p>This generation likes and expects companies to treat them as individuals, which is great for targeted ads and addressable TV as long as the marketers get their targeting right. This generation has less tolerance for ads which they think don\'t concern them than older generations, such as car ads to people who don\'t drive or sportswear ads to people who don\'t merely dislike sport but also wearing sporty clothing in social situations. However, if targeted ads do get it right, this generation is more likely to respond well to advertisements which they feel are relevant and delivered on platforms which they actually use.</p>\n\n<p>Unless you are lucky enough to have data scientists on your team who are part of GenZ we counsel being very cautious about defining how they are likely to act with metrics, not least because it is something the generation doesn\'t particularly like. It is easy for older generations to fail to understand people who have been using smartphones since early childhood, and they are aware of this. Providing digitally native experiences tailored to this generation is a great way to reach them, and this will need research both about GenZ metrics and how they best to respond to being reached out to by companies. Transparency and conveying a meaningful story will help this process. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://adexchanger.com/data-driven-thinking/data-ethics-permission-is-not-the-problem/\">This article</a> by Tom Weiss, Deductive\'s Chief Data Scientist, on how to make targeted advertising ethical, is an excellent example of the kind of ethical and transparent thinking which is typical of GenZ and advertisers and those who sell advertising space would do well to consider its recommendations if as an industry we genuinely want to engage with GenZ.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 35, 8);

If data is the new oil, then consider those in data governance to be the site managers and operations teams who make sure that the oil is extracted efficiently, safely and profitably.</p>\n\n<p>Data governance is not about stopping members of staff from doing things with data. Best practice in data governance is about exercising positive control over every element of the data held by a company through pro-active management which includes planning, monitoring, and enforcement.</p>\n\n<p>Data governance should support a business, by helping that business to achieve its strategy and vision by defining and communicating both data strategies and policies. It is about understanding and promoting the company\'s data assets, tracking and enforcing legal compliance and managing the data and any problems relating to its use and storage. Data governance needs to work in every area of a company and is not the sole domain of the data operations or data science teams - or the legal or IT departments.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"developing-a-data-policy\">Developing a data policy</h2>\n\n<p>Data governance can only work effectively when an established set of rules and policies are explicitly defined. This establishing of rules is similar to how a state runs a country, and for the same reason - to avoid chaos, ensuring everything is orderly with clear guidelines for how to do things and what to do when things go wrong, and ultimately for the betterment of all. Companies need to take full responsibility for all the data in their care and for how they share that data. So there must be policies concerning all personally identifiable information and how, whenever the company holds it, how employes should use and with whom they should share it.</p>\n\n<p>It is vital to have these policies and rules written out and in place. However, written procedures are not sufficient unless the company fully incorporates them into the business culture and values of the company. All staff should be made fully aware of what these policies state, alongside their personal responsibility concerning policy compliance.</p>\n\n<p>Governance policies also demonstrate to customers and potential customers, among others, that there are rigorous standards around the use of data within the business, and that data - particularly customer data - is respected.</p>\n\n<p>Having a policy in place mitigates the impact of any data breach, loss or theft, as well as reducing the risk of this happening in the first place. Let\'s imagine a TV data breach has occurred at an organization. Compare the following two scenarios. In the first case, no data policy was in place. It takes a while to identify the low-level employee responsible for the breach. While s/he had made a mistake, it turns out s/he was new and hadn\'t received any training about the consequences of making such a mistake. And s/he could hardly be held responsible for the fact that a lot of PII data, which the company had failed to anonymize, was captured by the hackers. Who was responsible for the PII data? Nobody is sure. In the second scenario, everything is very different as those who wrote the governance policies had spent a lot of time thinking about data breaches. It is much less likely the breach would have occurred at all as the training of new staff in the norms of how the company treats its data would have both made mistakes less likely to happen and would have meant the staff member who made a mistake immediately reported the problem to his or her manager. Knowing a mistake had been made would have allowed the company to close the vulnerability before a breach occurred.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"appointing-a-data-steward\">Appointing a data steward</h2>\n\n<p>Data governance begins by appointing a data steward. S/he needs to control and manage the data per both company policy and any legal requirements, such as GDPR, and his/her responsibilities need to include all aspects of the data lifecycle, including collection, storage, quality, security, access, usage and licensing. These responsibilities can include, but are not limited to: • Creating a gateway structure for any new requests for data usage. • Devising a standard procedure for dealing with any new requests to ship data to third-parties outside the business • Approving any changes that occur, or requests made to change existing in/out data feeds. • Devising or approving all key policies and processes, as well as any changes made over time to these policies and procedures. • Promoting a data science culture across all areas of the business so that all employees understand the value of the data -although the steward should have the support of senior management for this endeavor.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"benefits-of-data-governance\">Benefits of data governance</h2>\n\n<p>Data governance is a necessity for even smaller companies that are trying to embark on a TV analytics program – but members of staff should not view it as a chore. Data governance brings multiple benefits for companies: • Increased control of the data and hence of how the company operates, with this control in the hands of high-level executives • Understanding the rules of the road. With good data governance, it becomes much easier to see what is possible and what isn\'t. • Insulation from, and reduced risk of, data breaches, hacking, etc. • Increased accountability. With good data governance, it becomes much easier to see who is responsible for what, meaning things don’t get dropped or missed. • Across the board, the entire team will get a much better sense of the value of the company\'s data and why they need to get tasks such as manual data inputs right every time. Members of staff will also trust in the data and the data processes more than before. </p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 36, 8);

It might be great to have a large volume of data to work with, but it also means you need a complicated process to figure out what data the company has in a report that lists these assets in a straightforward, easy-to-understand manner. At Deductive, our data science consulting team generally counsels that companies should be primarily looking to see what business value these data have for their company, and how they can use these data to increase profitability and efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>Data mining is the process of extracting useful information from data and is typically done using some predictive analytics, whether off-the-shelf or with software built by the company. We strongly recommend the latter, i.e., doing your data mining, for any company which has the data science team and the resources to do so. The goal of any initial data mining is to extract a detailed report about what the data contain and what business value they have. Only then can they accurately figure out what to do with the data to maximize their profit, while at the same time deleting any unnecessary data and pseudonymizing any PII data.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"getting-the-data-ready\">Getting the data ready</h2>\n\n<p>Once the team fully understands the business value of the data, it is necessary to understand the data which they are mining. This process is different to the extraction of the data itself and involves understanding where the data have come from, typically from a whole variety of different places, and how and how often the data team is collecting additional data to add to the original datasets. So data about how customers interact with an app will be added to, perhaps daily, as these interactions happen every day. The way to do this is to describe the data, noting any which are particularly important (such as PII data). Once the team has understood the data, they need to be validated and cleansed. Failure to do this would seriously compromise the data mining.</p>\n\n<p>When the team has adequately prepared the data, they will be ready to be modeled by using mathematical modeling techniques for mapping the data and for the predictive analytics process. The models may not work, typically because of poorly prepared data, but also for other reasons where the data mining team will need to figure out what is the problem; successfully doing this is a significant step forward. The final stage before life deployment can happen is the evaluation, where the model and the data are tested to see what sorts of analytic insights they produce. Checking the integrity of these insights is essential. Using incomplete or inaccurate data mining insights in the business could create a worse situation than doing no data mining at all. Merely because analytic results look coherent after a brief review is not a sufficient reason to assume that they are right. When the evaluation stage is finished the data mining models are ready to go live.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"take-a-look-at-your-competition\">Take a look at your competition</h2>\n\n<p>Once the data science team has completed these stages, they should then try to assess, in as far as it is possible to do so, what data their rivals, and any other companies in the same industry, both have and lack. In this way, the team can build a more accurate picture of the business value their data may have.</p>\n\n<p>Building this picture should include the potential the data have to do new tasks, which needs data quality. So the company might be using a dataset in a particular way, say in identifying potential new customers, but the same dataset could also be used to help reduce churn for actual customers. The data team can only find new ways to use the data by ensuring that their mining focusses on comprehending the business values of the data.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps a rival added OTT to its linear offering in one region and, in spite of some implementation issues, the service has been very successful. What data are they using to make their VOD service better? How can ee avoid making the mistakes that they have made? Or perhaps a rival has devised a new and very successful segmentation system, marketing specifically towards sport into enthusiasts and casuals. If they are growing market share, then the question is how to acquire the same data assets to implement the same strategy?</p>\n\n<p>This particular way of segmenting would have been an innovative and risky decision for the company. However, once it is clear what a great decision it was, with the data showing why and how the conclusion was successful, it\'s easy for a data science team to replicate the same strategy. Most of the data which helps rivals increase upselling and reduce churn is publicly available for a fair market rate and must be of interest to other divisions which want to do the same.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"mining-the-archive\">Mining the archive</h2>\n\n<p>Broadcaster\'s archives are a potential goldmine. If a company has tens of thousands of shows going back to the seventies, they usually syndicate these shows on OTT services both in-house and externally. However, there is also likely to be a lot of data associated with these shows, which also have business value. Descriptions of these programs and other metadata could now have great value for the website of the OTT service. Or by digitizing the scripts from thousands of drama and comedy shows, including both the smash hits and the flops we can use artificial intelligence, to help assess new content, focussing on the best ideas and techniques from the smash hits and avoiding the worst pitfalls of the flops.</p>\n\n<p>This might sound like content generation by machine, but as well as using data mining to profile your customers and potential customers, it\'s important to focus on the applications of data to the full breadth of the company: if you\'re not trying it, you can be sure that your competitors are.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 37, 8);

However, before you start looking at this kind of predictive analytics you have to get the basics in place first.</p>\n\n<p>When advising customers on how to build out their mobile analytics, we usually look at a hierarchy of downloads, users and events (including sessions and views). In this article, we\'re going to look at each in turn and understand how best to use them.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"downloads\">Downloads</h2>\n\n<p>While the classic metric for analyzing apps is how often customers download the app, this can be a misleading metric (although it is often the first thing that management teams generally want to know).

There are a multitude of reasons why a user might uninstall your app, and these factors can be instructive. Some reasons - a user has run out of memory, competitor activity - are mostly outside of your control. Others - too buggy, too many ads, not engaging enough - are not. Metrics which the company can do something about are always going to be more useful than metrics which it is harder to see how to change.</p>\n\n<p>Apart from this uninstall metric, what our data science consulting team see as the most critical download metric is the cost per install; i.e., how much is the company spending per install or, even better, per actual customer. While this is an easy calculation for cost per device downloaded, it is important to keep focused on the number of customers and not the number of devices, even though this is a more difficult metric to calculate.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"users\">Users</h2>\n\n<p>In focussing on users, it is very useful to differentiate between a new and a returning user. Given that many users try an app and then abandon it (typically about 50% within three months according to some benchmarks), it is useful to know how many of those who abandoned the app will then return; we consider it likely that any app will have a sufficient number of returning customers for the metric to be worth measuring.</p>\n\n<p>Other usage metrics we recommend companies embark on as a priority include:</p>\n\n<p>• <strong>User flow</strong>, modeling the path taken by an average user in completing a task on the app • <strong>Path analysis</strong>, examining the relationships between the variables that may occur when a customer uses the app. Both this and user flow are important for gaining a rounded picture of how a user engages with your app. • <strong>Funnels</strong>, exploring the steps a user takes to reach a goal, such as becoming a paying customer. By understanding each step a customer takes to get to the goal it becomes easier to encourage new users to follow the same path. Goals are a set of activities which have been defined by the app provider, such as that a customer watches x hours of video or shares x articles with their friends or a goal could perhaps be something as simple as creating a playlist. These goals need to be tightly defined while building the app, and specifically its analytics, and then monitored closely.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"events-sessions-and-views\">Events, sessions, and views</h2>\n\n<p>The next step is to try and calculate how your users are actually using the app. Events, sessions, and views focus on what users are doing with the app.</p>\n\n<p>• <strong>Events</strong> are any kind of event happening as the customer uses the app and are particularly important because they help drive both customer retention and customer engagement and are an easy way to understand how the app is used by real customers, as opposed to what the app provider intended. Typical examples of events include watching a video or buying something through the app; though merely viewing a page would not be classified as an event. Unlike with views, the app provider needs to define these events within the analytics process where they can be beneficial for gaining a picture of how customers are using the app, including which parts are popular and which aren\'t.</p>\n\n<p>• <strong>Events</strong> are any event happening as the customer uses the app and are particularly important because they help drive both customer retention and customer engagement and are an easy way to understand how the app is used by real customers, as opposed to what the app provider intended.

Trying to understand why users enter and leave the app is always a useful metric. When does a session end? Either after a certain period (say 20 mins after activity ceases or at a particular time, e.g., midnight, or when the user closes the app). Closure is a useful session metric albeit an even more interesting one is noting what is called a campaign change, where a user enters the app via a campaign, leaves the app and then re-enters via a different campaign.</p>\n\n<p>• <strong>Views</strong> refers to screen views, which is any view of a page in your website accessed through the app. This kind of tracking is generally built within the apps internal analytic system, so nothing has to be done other than ensure you are using the dataset which contains this data for all your app downloads. It is, however, useful information as it shows what consumers do with the app. If you can match this info against, say, which users don\'t abandon the app within three months and those who do it is possible to build a picture of which activities are making this a popular app, and which aren\'t, information which can be used to develop the app, perhaps adding new features and withdrawing unpopular ones.</p>\n\n<p>And then there\'s revenue. This underpins your success or otherwise, and can then be used to calculate cost per acquisition. Finally, we would recommend that you track ratings from those app stores which offer your app. Comparing these to the ranking of your competitors (i.e., those with similar apps) is essential. If you aren\'t satisfied with user engagement with your app the first question to ask is whether your competitors are doing any better. If they are, you are in the right app business but need to tweak your app to make it more attractive.</p>\n\n<p>App analytics is an entire industry in itself, and there are almost limitless things that you can do when you start reporting and modeling the data your app produces, we recommend the above as good starting steps.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 38, 8);

Here are our key takeaways from the show.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"tv-is-in-rude-healthor-is-it\">TV is in rude health…or is it?</h3>\n\n<p>TV events usually contain a healthy dose of chest thumping about how healthy the industry is. One could, if one desired, make a long checklist of the types of phrases reliably trotted out by industry execs ($72bn transacted…check! Best medium for building brand awareness…check! Gold standard..check!). So it was illuminating to hear Turner\'s Larry Allen kick off his afternoon keynote by getting straight to an entirely different point, namely, that the current TV advertising model is broken. His argument, loosely summarized, is \"too many spots, too little targeting\". That\'s not hugely surprising to hear at a data conference, and there were plenty of robust defenses of the status quo on display. However, it\'s a sign of where we are that a speaker from a top network group is so openly challenging said status quo on a stage at an industry event</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"how-much-tv-data-complexity-will-advertisers-take\">How much TV data complexity will advertisers take?</h3>\n\n<p>New data is needed to solve some of TV\'s challenges – on this, everyone now broadly agrees. The more interesting question is what data sets we use, and how best to apply TV analytics to them. CBS\' newly promoted analytics chief Radha Subramanyam hinted at a possible answer – all of them - by highlighting almost a dozen different sources of viewing data that her organization uses, including set-top-box data, Smart TV data and OTT data. The sheer volume of these datasets presents huge challenges for the buy and sell side – including many of our customers – around understanding how to get the most out of these data sets, and how to transact on them in a more streamlined fashion. Publicis\' Jonathan Steuer highlighted that TV needs to \"behave more like a platform in terms of planning, execution and measurement\". That\'s true, but perhaps if TV really is trying to be more like digital, as most speakers hinted at over the days, then acceptance of some of that complexity – at least from a data standpoint – is going to come with the territory TV wants to stake out.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"goodbye-attribution-hello-outcome-based-marketing\">Goodbye attribution, hello outcome-based marketing</h3>\n\n<p>Outcome-based marketing (essentially TV attribution, but with a much sexier name, as far as we can tell) was comfortably the biggest buzzword of the show and another sign of TV\'s desire to embrace the good of digital. A plethora (www.cubeiq.com) of (www.ispot.tv) vendors (www.dataxu.com) are targeting the space, interest in which has also been peaked by <a href=\"https://adage.com/article/special-report-tv-upfront/a-e-networks-sell-guarantee-tv-ads-drive-business-results/313401/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">networks like A&amp;E offering delivery-based outcomes</a> at this year\'s upfronts. There are a few obvious attractions to outcome-based marketing - competing with <a href=\"https://www.google.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">you know</a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> who</a>, more granular targeting - but a less heralded upside is attracting new advertisers to TV. Outcome-based marketing can help grow the pie by attracting both brands - particularly direct-to-consumer – and marketers who are very comfortable with approaches around sales conversions, search lift, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Attribution isn\'t perfect. Challenges remain on how to properly attribute actions in specific categories (how do you attribute the purchase of a car, or any category with a six-month decision cycle, on a single spot?). However, perhaps the bigger challenge for TV is how to balance its newly acquired ability to track outcomes with its current turf as a brand - and awareness-building medium - and a very good one at that. As Hulu\'s Julie DeTraglia nicely put it, nobody is going to subscribe to her service if they don\'t know it exists.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"bad-datasets-are-going-to-get-found-out\">Bad datasets are going to get found out</h3>\n\n<p>\"Data science is a bullsh*t term, and we\'re all bullsh*t artists\" – words not spoken by us, but by a leading network\'s head of data science. He was joking (at least that\'s what we told our data science consulting team) – but he did inadvertently strike upon an issue we see more and more with our clients: data quality and transparency.</p>\n\n<p>If TV data is still a bit of a Wild West, inevitably, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4XxN1modZU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">not all providers are going to be Rooster Cogburn</a>. Not all TV datasets are created equal, and at the show our CTO Tom Weiss shared our experience of working with poor quality audience segments that we\'ve seen being traded – <a href=\"https://deductive.com/scoring-data-quality/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">something we\'ve blogged about before</a>.</p>\n\n<p>All datasets have strengths and weaknesses, and it was refreshing to hear Inscape\'s Zeev Neumeier telling delegates \"they should be careful what they wish for\" when using his dataset. If buyers and sellers are to accept compromises in the data they use to trade - in the same way digital buyers and sellers do - dataset providers must be transparent about what their data can and cannot do.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dont-forget-about-the-consumer\">Don\'t forget about the consumer</h3>\n\n<p>It\'s easy for us data wonks to get caught up in match rates, upscaling, panel balancing and all the rest, and forget that part of the benefit of data-driven TV advertising is to improve the experience for consumers. To that end, Turner showed some fascinating research the network had carried out with consumers around the kinds of new TV advertising experiences they\'d like to see. One result was a single 5-minute long central spot, which tested very well. Turner also shared psychographic research around ad receptivity – a consumer that watches CNN in the morning is going to be more receptive to certain types of ads than TBS in the evening. <a href=\"/blogs/ai-tv-industry/\">We\'ve written before about how the future of TV advertising is also about bringing in more of these kinds of contextual insights into the mix</a>. This kind of small data, if you want to call it that, is going to be just as important as its shoutier, limelight-hogging big brother in the future of TV.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 39, 8);
INSERT INTO `aldryn_newsblog_article_translation` VALUES (40, 'en', 'How addressable might work in a GDPR world', 'germany-addressable-gdpr', '<p>Addressable TV - technology that advertisers can use to target TV ads at particular households or devices - is generating significant column inches within the TV industry. But GDPR is - at least partially - extinguishing some of the hype in Europe. It\'s the first thing most customers in Europe ask us about. [Addressable TV often relies on third-party data] (https://martechtoday.com/addressable-tv-state-cross-device-ad-buying-203737) to execute the buy, and third-party data is subject to some of the most stringent parts of the GDPR.</p>\n\n<p>But we think that some of the examples we see in Germany - which already has strict, GDPR-like privacy regulation at a federal level - should negate some of those concerns. Germany has some of the most stringent privacy laws in the world, and many of the provisions found in GDPR already exist in German law. Yet we have seen big companies on the sell side, particularly ProSiebenSat.1, using probabilistic matching to target viewers in a way that adheres to the country\'s privacy laws</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"tv-gdpr-enter-probabilistic-matching\">TV GDPR: Enter probabilistic matching</h2>\n\n<p>While more traditional ad campaigns do not require advanced data sets, the very nature of addressable TV means that sophisticated, high-quality datasets are needed to target the right people with the right ads. The critical challenge for businesses operating in the EU is to build and use these datasets without violating the new GDPR privacy laws.</p>\n\n<p>Under GDPR, individuals in the EU have the right to view any data held about them regardless of the location of the company or the stored data and have the right to demand the rectification of their data. Individuals can also request the deletion of their data unless the company can provide a compelling reason not to do so, which it is unlikely to be able to do for data used in addressable TV. A company can argue that it needs to store the pseudonymized physical address and the IP address of its customers so they can receive products, make repairs, etc., but is not going to be able to argue that they also need such data for the datasets used in targeting ads.</p>\n\n<p>This is where probabilistic matching comes in. Unlike deterministic matching, it does not use personally identifiable information but instead focusses on the likely characteristics of the households it wants to reach. One company we see doing this in Europe is ProSiebenSat.1, a free-to-air and pay-TV German broadcaster which has been particularly innovative in creating successful addressable TV campaigns using Smart TV data. PSS.1 models attributes based on IP location, combining this IP location with weather data, on technical features and attributes modelled from AGF, the German association providing the official TV audience ratings (i.e., the German Nielsen). These modelled attributes include viewing behaviours such as the demographics which typically watch particular genres or segments, e.g., women 18-44 tend to like romantic comedies, men of all ages tend to like soccer, etc. The technical features which PSS.1 use to help them create targeted ads include the platform the customer is using, the time of day a customer is watching TV and whether they are watching via DVB or DTH.</p>\n\n<p>Retargeting is a technique which PSS.1 have developed with some carefully selected partners, who agree to share their data though they also use TV data gathered from their own services. GDPR demands that partners explicitly opt-in, but given the voluntary nature of the association this is easy to achieve. PSS.1 have been working on expanding their own range of digital assets because the company can then use the data which comes with these assets in the re-targeting process.</p>\n\n<p>Our data science consulting team see PSS.1 as having the best model for GDPR compliance regarding addressable TV, and we expect to see the majority of TV companies operating in the EU region to follow their model in four specific ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>By targeting based on geo features such as where you live (not just the name of a street but factors such as average wealth in that area and whether it is raining, a weather factor likely to increase viewing).</li>\n	<li>The technical features of the viewing device (so news programs are more likely to be viewed on a smartphone than the latest blockbuster film.)</li>\n	<li>Building segments through modelling by using panel data and some small opt-in pools to match different viewing behaviours with different targeted ads.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Talk to our data science team if you want to learn more about probabilistic targeting and modelling</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 40, 1);

The starting point for many conversations our data science consulting team has with customers is that said customers want to move from relying on \"traditional market research\" to \"big data\" - or words to that effect.</p>\n\n<p>We always applaud companies wanting to embrace data more, but we also counsel our customers against throwing the baby out with the bath water. Even in an era of big data, there is still tremendous value in traditional research methods. In this article, we look at how one company</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"netflix-and-segmentation-on-steroids\">Netflix and segmentation on steroids</h2>\n\n<p>In particular, we\'re always surprised at how quickly our clients sometimes want to move toward targeting each customer on an individual basis - \"like Netflix\" - instead of targeting them in groups. There are a few issues with this - it takes a long time and a lot of effort to go from one extreme - mass targeting  - to the other - 100% personalised targeting - and is not a change that can happen overnight. But more to the point, even the most analytically advanced companies are still using audience segments to target their customers. Yes, even Netflix.</p>\n\n<p>Netflix gathers vast amounts of data about the viewing habits of its customers which it then uses to help key decision-makers make the decisions on which programs and new seasons to invest in and which to reject. This data-driven approach gives consumers programs they want to watch, even when they consume the latest blockbuster season in a single night. What we find particularly interesting is how Netflix is using audience segments.</p>\n\n<p>Netflix explicitly rejects using the traditional demographic segments typified by Nielsen et al. It makes no effort to segment its audience by age, gender, location, and so on. But it does have a sophisticated segmentation around content usage. Netflix has categorized users by their viewing habits into roughly 2,000 micro-segments, and it is this that partly powers the Netflix viewing algorithm. That\'s to say, what appears on your Netflix menu is not driven solely by you and what you like, but by your presence in these segments.</p>\n\n<p>Netflix automatically categorizes any customer into some of these micro-segments. For example, why does Netflix need to know someone is in the Latino demographic if it can see by their viewing habits that this person mostly watches TV in Spanish. And, with those Latinos who prefer English-language TV, Netflix\'s micro-segments work even better. Consumer viewing habits draw up a more accurate picture of customer demand than Nielsen\'s segmentation by demographics, which arguably is what gives Netflix its competitive edge over its more traditional rivals. Netflix\'s segmentation also explains how, having clawed its way to the top through its innovative uses of data, it has managed to remain the most significant player in the OTT space.</p>\n\n<p>Netflix\'s micro-segments are comparable to assigning an in interest in particular TV genres. Netflix uses what it describes as \"verticals,f\" which are very sub-specific genres. So while drama is a typical genre and both romance and period drama can be considered sub-genres of drama, a Netflix vertical would be period romance. They also have a vertical called young comedy though this does not mean that only young people will watch shows in this vertical, given that \"young people\" is demographic data.</p>\n\n<p>These verticals have successfully allowed Netflix to capitalize on their initial growth, and remain tremendously popular. They have also used verticals in the structure of their organization. Genre heads - and sub-genre heads - within Netflix are widely understood to have more decision-making power than their equivalents at a conventional network. This way of working is what allows the company to produce roughly a thousand shows in 2018 alone, a particularly impressive statistic given it created its first show a mere seven years ago. Netflix also says that despite having many verticals shows which are difficult to define by a particular vertical, and therefore may have a broader appeal, are often the most successful new shows.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"lessons-for-the-industry\">Lessons for the industry</h2>\n\n<p>Our data science consulting team likes to use the Netflix example with our customers to help them to understand the continued importance of traditional market research methods when it comes to understanding its customer base, and how to use TV data to target them.</p>\n\n<p>What it demonstrates is that reaching the nirvana of personalized targeting does not happen without the creation of a lot of audience clusters or segments first-and all the data engineering that goes with that. It also reinforces a broader point that \"old\" and \"new\" methods of understanding your customers will continue to coexist for some time. In our industry, it also highlights the move away from demographics research, with companies instead using data and data science to create new and improved segmentation models, both for TV shows and the people who watch them. Or to put it another way, something old - segmentation - is a small step towards something newer - personalized TV - even though it may not immediately seem like it.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 41, 8);

A solid mathematical background is crucial actually to get data science models to work.</p>\n\n<p>Some competence in coding and an understanding of what the works of data is also a plus. We particularly like our data scientists to be competent in Python and its data manipulation and analysis software library, Pandas, as well as having a reasonable amount of experience with SQL. Beyond that, there are some other softer skills that we look for:</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"being-comfortable-getting-lost\">Being comfortable getting lost</h2>\n\n<p>Data science consulting is different from other IT disciplines in that it is far less defined. \"Data science\" can mean five things to five different people, and there can be hundreds of different types of problems to solve. Any of these might require three different tools that the data science team may or may not have used before. So we tend to favor candidates who are comfortable using reporting and modelling tools that they have not used before, rather than those who are very skilled in a few languages or methods but dislike the ambiguity of working with new approaches.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"logical-problem-solvers\">Logical problem solvers</h2>\n\n<p>The range of approaches necessitates candidates who can think logically about how best to solve a problem.

We also like candidates who can defend their approaches and can advocate their approach to their peers-even if some of them may favor a different approach. Rigorous debate is good!</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"communicate-communicate-communicate\">Communicate, communicate, communicate</h2>\n\n<p>The traditional idea of geeky techies who won\'t let anyone drag them away from his/her beloved computer screens, and who are brilliant at writing algorithms, but can\'t communicate with others, tends not to work for us. Staying firmly out of view may have worked in the past with more traditional IT jobs, but in 2018 a data scientist\'s ability to communicate across the business and with customers is vital because of how their work will impact the company and its employees. The data scientist may well want to change data handling practices across the business. Unless the data scientist can communicate the desirability and necessity of these changes in a persuasive manner and using non-technical language, they are unlikely to achieve their goals. Also, the needs of the business and the customers it serves are central to the data science work, and so a data scientist also needs to be a good listener.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"realism-about-the-job\">Realism about the job</h2>\n\n<p>Data science still has some \"rock star\" kudos attached to it, which can lead to misconceptions about what the job entails.

We like to compare data science to accountancy to make this point. Accountants have access to the company cash and the books and so are generally well-positioned to commit fraud, should they be minded too. However, in 2018, data is among the most valuable assets most companies have. Its security is paramount, and the data scientists create the security and access to that data every day. We want potential hires to have an understanding of the role they play in maintaining this, and in how people access the data.</p>\n\n<p>For data scientists, it\'s also about how they use that data, and what the outputs of any work they do may have on people.

If, for example, we have a connected smart TV on a static IP address that we only ever see on a single mobile device, then – provided we have a large enough dataset – we can be confident that this mobile device matches with the home of that connected smart TV. Any viewing on the TV can be associated with the owner of that mobile device, mainly if we see the same IP address on the mobile phone at the same time that the TV is switched on.</p>\n\n<p>Such examples are unfortunately few and far between, and it is much more common for mobile phones and web browsers to appear on multiple different IP addresses at different times. In the absence of an anchor device like a connected TV – which we know is likely to be physically stationary – we can only build up the device graph of the home by looking for sets of devices commonly observed on the same IP addresses at the same time. In data science terms, this is a “market basket” problem, similar to Amazon’s “people who bought this also bought this” we are looking for “people who were on this IP address were also on this IP address.” We approach this problem of mining association rules using the Apriori algorithm, and this gives us a probabilistically combined set of devices that are frequently seen together on the same IP address.</p>\n\n<p>These set of rules subsequently need to be cleaned to remove IP address with too many different devices on them (most likely offices, VPN access points, military bases, or a local Starbucks), and we need assign devices to an individual household.

If we have enough information, we can go further and infer the activities of specific individuals within the home as well.</p>\n\n<p>The quality of the model will depend not only on the quality of the data science put into it but also on the breadth and depth of the datasets. If we have data for many millions of devices and multiple different device types, then we’ll have a very rich dataset to create a device graph. If we’re limited only to mobile devices, browser cookies, or smart TVs, then we’ll have fewer options. As is frequently the case, diversity of data sources is the key to creating an enriched dataset, and the quality of the IP graph exponentially increases the more datasets we add.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 45, 1);

The average viewer says they want to spend 45 seconds deciding on starting to watch something, and this is a critical and tiny time-window where well-organized content and smart recommendations can direct a potential viewer to content they view.</p>\n\n<p>AI can help viewers to rapidly discover the content they want by managing the data and metadata offering smart and personalized recommendations and brilliant search results that swiftly take them to what they are most likely to want to watch, regardless of their taste in genres. There are applications like this already, such as the now ubiquitous recommendation engines that MVPDs and operators use to surface content.</p>\n\n<p>Where AI can add value is in offering a much more consistent approach to presenting and describing this data. Poorly organized metadata can be very visible to the baffled viewer, e.g., tagging a soccer game as drama, wasting the valuable 45-second customer window. Soccer may be full of high drama but meta-tagging it with this tag is simply incorrect from the perspective of TV genres. AI can help by being better and much faster at tagging accurately.</p>\n\n<p>Meta tags are particularly useful in an AI-powered search. Metadata from third parties are notoriously disparate. They are often not standardized and can be used differently by different providers. For example, tagging soccer as football may mean World Cup matches appear in searches for viewers looking for American football but don\'t appear in results for soccer. AI can be used to reduce these errors, by validating (and if necessary modifying) inconsistent meta tags.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"voice-commands-and-tv\">Voice commands and TV</h2>\n\n<p>The integration of AI-powered assistants into TV services will provide a new level of data for the TV industry to use. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/lg-tvs-get-google-assistant-voice-controls/\">OEMs like LG have integrated Google\'s voice assistant into devices</a>. We\'re excited about the potential of these systems, and the data science that powers them, providing a much clearer picture of not just what people do when watching TV, but why.</p>\n\n<p>Let\'s imagine a family starts watching a new drama, but they start to get bored after ten minutes. They tell the remote to change the channel where they watch an old cop show for ten minutes. When the ads come on, they tell the Assistant to lower the volume, an indication they are watching the ads but responding to their tendency to be a little louder. We can insinuate that the family is watching the ads, but responding to the fact that ads are usually a little louder than the broadcast. This is a simple example of where voice assistants can add color to the data.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe after the show, they search for another show to watch by asking for TV schedules or setting reminders for future programs. We know that more of this type of data will become available as the adoption of smart homes and smart cities technology becomes mainstream. The challenge for the industry will be to understand how to classify and harness this data, and use the reporting and modelling to make better decisions</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"producing-content-using-data-analytics\">Producing content using data analytics</h2>\n\n<p>The use of any kind of algorithm to help to commission or produce great content is controversial, and one that strikes to the heart of how science can impact the artistic and creative side of the TV industry. We don\'t see a future where robots are writing the latest episode of The Big Bang Theory, but we think AI can be used to help to create great TV content.</p>\n\n<p>If writing for a comedy, a data science consulting team could build an AI application that could access an extensive database of previously written successful comedy scripts as well as another database of comedy pilot scripts for shows that failed. Perhaps all the successful shows averaged 10-15 jokes or funny moments per hour where the failures averaged either more or less than this. So whereas AI is not capable of writing jokes that we would find funny, it can help the human writer to structure the new script based on its insights into what has worked in the past.</p>\n\n<p>AI could also help by suggesting characters and plots although it is the human that will have to convert these suggestions into a viable script. We already see some companies moving in this space. Vion Labs, for example, has built an AI system that analyzes in detail the content of a movie or TV, down to the level of the number of gunshots fired, or movie kisses. Any patters it derives can be used to understand what people like in a show, in a way that is more granular way than humans can themselves express. Adding these kinds of insights to the content production process can ultimately help content creators to make better shows.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 46, 8);

At Deductive, we have seen first hand in TV analysis, typified by the shift in assessing TV audiences using panel data only, to a mixed-methodology that includes smart-TV, set-top box and OTT data.</p>\n\n<p>The two approaches are fundamentally different. Panel data is generated by a strict research-based approach and provides a “gold standard” for audience measurement in most markets. It is a classic example of a small, managed data set.</p>\n\n<p>Panel data now sits alongside other far larger, more unwieldy datasets that teach us more about how people watch TV, and which allow us to act directly on those insights. But these datasets require much more management, and work, to be useful for us.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"in-with-the-new\">In with the new</h2>\n\n<p>The relative merits and demerits of panel data and big data have been hashed out multiple times. But what’s particularly interesting is how we see some of the same trends – and debates – occurring in other industries as well.</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>In healthcare, we are starting to see a shift from focusing on clinical trials to one where data gathered from all hospitals is used to improve services, while pharmaceutical companies are focusing on personalized medicine based on genetic data and data gathered through Internet-of-Things devices</li>\n	<li>In the auto industry, using data to decide what makes a great driving experience and an attractive and exciting car has replaced the research that answered those same questions in the past. In finance, research to help banks, hedge funds and insurance companies make their complex decisions are replaced with much larger data sets, and in some cases it is artificial intelligence and not humans which are making the day-to-day buying, selling and loaning decisions.</li>\n	<li>In the chemicals industry, companies have typically achieved their resource and planning allocation as a process based on research that would be implemented once or twice a year. This is now an ongoing process, based on the collection and understanding (through mining and analytics) of big data, resulting in vital improvements in efficiency and cost-saving that are being implemented much more often.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The most interesting startup disrupting an industry through the innovative use of data is probably Tesla in the auto industry. The company broke the mold by saying that its electric cars were going to be better, i.e., faster and better looking, as well as more environmentally-friendly, than their gas-driven competitors. They have since consolidated their success with driverless vehicles, a success based in part on Tesla\'s analysis of the data gathered about the driving habits of 60,000 of its vehicles sold with this data-gathering ability. And, by updating the software in its cars, Tesla can upgrade their features, e.g., adding driverless features, without the cars having to return to the manufacturers. And, because of Tesla’s success, the more established players in the industry have followed Tesla, both with electric cars and with their use of data, algorithms and artificial intelligence.</p>\n\n<p>At Deductive, our data strategy team advises established companies on how to use data in innovative ways to remain competitive and prevent disruption from new and innovative data-driven startups. We can see resistance to this new data-driven approach, often because the data is not “managed” in the same way research panels are managed. The data needs gathering and significant pre-processing, cleansing and validation before it is useful. This is a far cry from the more \"finished\" product that is the output of a research panel.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"learning-to-get-along\">Learning to get along</h2>\n\n<p>Looking at other how the old and the new co-exist in other verticals may give us some clues as to how these two opposing approaches will eventually co-exist in TV. To use our healthcare example, we haven’t seen an end to the use of clinical trials in healthcare – and we probably won’t. They are still heavily regulated, and the data that comes from said trials still drives whether a drug does or does not get manufactured. But big data from lots of hospitals is helping the healthcare industry solve problems and answer questions that clinical trials cannot - better and closer monitoring of individual patients, more and more granular inputs for modelling, population health management, to name but a few use cases. These applications are ancillary to clinical trials – not a replacement, and the same is true for TV. New data sets are supplementing the data analysis we can do. Tesla is probably the most extreme example of this - it is doing things with data that could never be done via a managed approach.</p>\n\n<p>The other impact that is common across industries is a change in the amount of attention given to different parts of the data workflow. A huge amount of labor goes into the design and creation of a clinical trial, which results in a small, manageable and, hopefully, accurate data set. There is a parallel in TV here too. Much of the effort in creating a panel goes in the initial management and design stage, and then in the maintenance of said panel (as opposed to the data, which is an important distinction to make). A big TV dataset does not have this need, but a huge amount of work goes into managing the output of such data sets (something our data engineering team can attest too!).</p>\n\n<p>The question is not whether one approach is superior, but what either approach can actually do. As has happened in other verticals, we expect new data sets in TV to continue to thrive, as they continue to help the TV industry to do things that old market research methods were never designed to do.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 50, 6);

INSERT INTO `aldryn_newsblog_article_translation` VALUES (52, 'en', 'Making TV more accountable with Smart TV data', 'making-tv-more-accountable-with-smart-tv-data', '<p>One of the notable themes of the last few years is that TV advertising is trying to become more like digital in terms of targeting and accountability. This convergence is good for brands and good for TV because it provides more consistency for buyers across different media and demonstrates the power of TV.</p>\n\n<p>Multi-touch attribution is the key enabler of this accountability. For digital, the last-click attribution model allows companies such as Google and Facebook to take direct credit for customer conversion in a measurable way - and profit accordingly. Before digital advertising started, when a customer bought a new LG fridge, they would credit this to the customer having seen a lot of TV ads for LG. If all my friends are jealous of my new fridge, it almost certainly isn\'t due to Google, as most of them will have never entered the LG website via Google ads, but to brand recognition, having seen endless TV ads for LG over an extended period. And if LG increased their TV advertising budget, they would expect to see a subsequent increase in fridge sales.</p>\n\n<p>Google and Facebook overturned this model with last-click attribution. If the customer clicks on a Google or Facebook ad to go to the LG website, where they then order a new fridge, then these companies claim the purchase should be attributed to them. They have the measurements to prove it (they say) and have profited accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>Their success is in spite of the fact that many companies may not get their brand awareness from Google or Facebook. However, it was equally clear that the only response the TV industry could make to unseat last click attribution was to develop similar ways of measuring the impact of TV ads. Google and Facebook can easily measure the last click, as well as other indicators such as how often someone saw the ad before clicking on it, and what they did once they had clicked on the ad, whether making a purchase or leaving the website ten seconds later. Measuring TV advertising is more complicated and uses multi-touch attribution to map the customers\' journey towards a conversion, i.e., making a purchase. So, given that the new LG TV ad was seen in the customers\' household 11 times in the last week, how did this contribute to the sale?</p>\n\n<p>To answer the question, we first need to look at what data we have to measure attribution. Traditionally, audience ratings have been calculated by Nielsen in the US (since 1950), BARB in the UK and similar organizations elsewhere. Nielsen\'s panel data still plays the key role of overall audience measurement, but big data sets (OTT; Smart TV data; return-path data) can, with the right match fabric, provide measurements such as attributing the number of new users to a website to the people who have seen the company\'s TV ad. However, there are further datasets whose addition can help paint a more accurate, multi-touch picture of the customer journey to conversion.</p>\n\n<p>A highly measurable dataset is direct response TV ads, which ask for a direct response from the viewer. So Geico might offer a lower price if you ring a specific number. The ROI can then be calculated based on the number of phone calls received from subsequent buyers, though creating this dataset has extra costs, i.e., having to pay for the special offer and run or extend a call-center.</p>\n\n<p>The availability of set-top-box and smart TV data has further opened up TV to last click attribution. By matching the IP address of the TV where the viewer saw an ad with the IP address of the viewer who has visited the website we can build up a pattern of consumer exposure to advertising across different media. This approach is known as multi-touch attribution and, for major consumer purchase decisions, we can map brand exposure over an extended period of time and involving many hundreds of TV brand exposures, Google ad exposures, online display adverts, and visits to the brands\' website.</p>\n\n<p>When the buyer decision is to purchase a new product the advertising is normally designed to drive people to buy in-store or from home delivery. Where the product was bought online the last click to the website is not the only point that deserves credit for the purchase. When driving people instore, all the advertising dollars spent are now fighting against the incentives and targets given to the shop saleswoman responsible for selling the highest margin products for the retailer.</p>\n\n<p>With data from smart TVs, set-top-boxes, and digital, we can build up a complete picture that provides agencies justification for their buy, and brands with confidence that they are spending their ad dollars effectively. Now that\'s real accountability.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 52, 12);
INSERT INTO `aldryn_newsblog_article_translation` VALUES (53, 'en', 'Six things you need to get right for a data science culture', 'six-things-data-science-culture', '<p>At Deductive, we believe that creating a data science culture is the single biggest thing that business owners and CEOs can do to ensure the success of their enterprises in 2018 and beyond. Now, when most businesses believe that they are GDPR compliant, is not the time to sit back and forget about data until the passing of a new data law. To the contrary, there will never been a better moment to drive the data science culture of your business. Data science culture is the essential element of a robust and successful data strategy. In our experience working with data teams of all shapes and sizes, we\'ve seen companies getting data science culture both right and wrong. Here are some of the things the successful examples have in common:</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"1-start-at-the-top\">1) Start at the top</h2>\n\n<p>The first and foremost component of a data science culture is that it starts at the top, with the CEO and other key decision-makers fully committing themselves to its cultivation. Their aim should be to create a data-driven culture across the business, using the data it has and could have to create leverage wherever possible. Another area where executives can create this culture is through recruitment, not only hiring people with the right experience and enthusiasm for data but also ensuring that the company has a data steward, to oversee data strategy and a data protection officer (DPO) for data security. Facilitating the other features, such as ensuring there is time and money available for training is essential, as is making sure all top-level executives are well-versed in data issues with at least some hands-on experience. Finally, leaders set the example and so the actions of your executives need to demonstrate how much they value a data science culture. If employees see that management can\'t be bothered to get the data right, it is likely they won\'t make an effort either.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"2-focus-on-the-staff-not-just-the-policies\">2) Focus on the staff, not just the policies</h2>\n\n<p>Data science culture needs to be staff-focused. After all, culture is all about the human aspect. We find that the leading cause of the failure of a company\'s data strategy isn\'t data itself, but staff-related. This failure is why we stress the importance of creating a vibrant data science culture within any organization where there are interactions between human employees and data. We find that the executives in most companies underestimate the importance of fostering a data science culture, even though it is the staff and not themselves who are having to collect, cope with and ensure the smooth working and flowing of the data on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"3-regular-training-and-education\">3) Regular training and education</h2>\n\n<p>Regular training and educational sessions for mid-level staff are crucial, and not just practical sessions on the tools that they are using. Enthusing the teams about the power and value of the company\'s data, and the data they work with as individuals, not merely as a one-off session but in an ongoing way, is the first step. This educational process begins with getting the staff interested in the data. Getting them to identify the data they are using in their working lives and how they can use to improve their working lives - from a purely selfish point of view - is a good starting point. It is essential to paint the bigger picture to help motivate staff to feel part of a larger team but also so that they get a strong sense of the value of their work with the data being part of a greater whole. There\'s a negative side to this positive too, which is how even small data errors can have a more significant impact Concrete examples help reinforce this message. And your teams need to be trained to ask the right questions and to see the grey areas that always exist in the data they are dealing with and in the human-data interactions.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"4-teach-and-encourage-intuition\">4) Teach and encourage intuition</h2>\n\n<p>Staff should be taught to use their intuition when it comes to data, with concrete examples of how this might play out. If an employee convinced that some data passing through her desk seems incorrect should trust her senses and either explore further or tell her manager, and this spirit of questioning should be encouraged. In spite of the swiftness and intelligence of many algorithms and automated processes, humans can sometimes still spot specific errors in data more accurately than the most advanced computer program. Also, they are the ones who have similar datasets on their computer screens every day and will be the first to spot that something is different. When this happens, staff need to trust their intuition and be listened to by their managers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"5-sit-your-business-and-analytics-teams-in-the-same-place\">5) Sit your business and analytics teams in the same place</h2>\n\n<p>Your business and analytics teams are both working towards the same goals, so a great deal of productivity can be encouraged by interfacing between analytic and business units. Getting these teams working together in a training environment is beneficial, but we would extend this by having the people physically located in the same place, where possible, to encourage these interactions. This proximity breeds the kind of tacit understanding between these teams in which analytics thrives.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"6-make-the-data-as-easy-to-access-as-possible\">6) Make the data as easy to access as possible</h2>\n\n<p>All KPIs need to be data-driven and data-justified. Most companies know this. But getting buy-in for these KPIs across an organization is where organizations tend to go wrong. Your staff should have constant and easy access to the data you have so that they are part of the process of driving and improving KPIs and other important goals. Data should not only be shared at all-hands meetings. Most companies have a hierarchy of data users and set of associated data rights and privileges for each. The level of data that the Board and Management Team needs is usually quite clear; so is the level of access that a BI team needs. We often find that the middle of this spectrum non-senior team members, who do not have specific \"data roles\" - can be overlooked. But it is precisely these teams that need to be engaged to drive a widespread data science culture throughout the organization. So making sure these teams also have the right access to the data is crucial.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 53, 6);

An easy way to do this is to add a bucket policy that allows Deductive\'s AWS account access to your bucket(s). However, if you have alternative requirements then please <a href=\"mailto:api-support@deductive.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">get in touch to discuss</a>.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p><strong>How much data can I process in one file?</strong> Processing on the API is limited by time, approximately 30 seconds maximum per \'clean\' API call. The amount of data you can process in this time depends on the complexity of the rules being applied to the data. For complex processing you may need to split data files into smaller chunks.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p><strong>Can I process multiple files using one API call?</strong> At the moment the API only supports processing one file at a time.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p><strong>Why does the \'clean\' API call block for so long?</strong> The \'clean\' API call is synchronous so blocks whilst the data processing is underway.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p><strong>I\'m getting a timeout error. What\'s the problem?</strong> Processing on the API is limited by time, approximately 30 seconds maximum per \'clean\' API call. For complex processing you may need to split data files into smaller chunks.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p><strong>Can I process anything other than CSV files (e.g. JSON or XML)?</strong> Currently the API only supports CSV format files.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p><strong>How much does the service cost?</strong> Please see our listing in the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">AWS Marketplace</a> for details on pricing.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p><strong>Do you have any libraries to help me use the API?</strong> We currently don\'t provide any libraries to support the use of the API.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p><strong>I have a problem.

INSERT INTO `aldryn_newsblog_article_translation` VALUES (57, 'en', 'Boosting OTT subscriber numbers with TV data', 'boosting-ott-subscriber-numbers-with-tv-data', '<p>Customer acquisition can be a difficult task for OTT subscription businesses. Most potential customers want to watch decent TV programs (whatever that means to them) and are willing to pay a certain amount to do so. It\'s also slightly different to some of the other data-related problems we help solve, in that the focus is on customers that you don\'t have yet - whereas churn, upsell and so on rely on customers - and data - that you do.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, focusing on one\'s rivals and their services and brand reputation is no less important than concentrating on one\'s own, especially if they have a more significant share of the market than you do. The data you have on your actual customers can tell you a great deal about acquiring new ones because they too were acquired at some point.</p>\n\n<p>When we work with our customers to improve their customer acquisition, we typically start with a single customer view. This report combines all of the data you have about any customer in a single repository. Perhaps some teams across your business are already using a single-customer-view but are they sharing what they are doing? The data to make a single-customer-view will come from different sources, and many companies are collecting them in different places. Data sources typically include weblogs from Google Analytics, CRM data, smart TV data, set-top-box data, OTT TV data, financial data and data from third-party sources.</p>\n\n<p>All of this data can help you discover why your customers chose your OTT service. Can you identify how many customers chose you rather than a rival? And why did they pick you? Was it recommendations from friends and family? Or better coverage of a particular TV genre? Or better customer service? Or your competitive price? Your advertising campaign? And if so, from where? Terrestrial television? A billboard? Social media? Discovering what has driven actual customers to choose your services offers the solutions to attracting new subscribing. Not all data points can answer all of these questions, but a single customer view will get you as complete an answer as possible. With this in place, we should either a) realize that we don\'t have the data available to answer these questions, or b), have some understanding of the customers\' reasons for subscribing to the OTT service, and start developing strategies that respond better to their needs.</p>\n\n<p>If the former is the case, there is probably still more data that can be found to answer these questions. For instance, integrating what you want to know into the sign-up-process: merely asking the customer why they choose the service when they sign-up can be very revealing. Market research can take this a step further, but it\'s critical that this information is normalized and put together into the single-customer-view. Asking current customers these questions can be useful, too.</p>\n\n<p>With the latter, it is about understanding what works, and what doesn\'t. Ideally, this data can be benchmarked against either the industry or previous campaigns. If social media is underperforming, the decision is to either spend less or to change the mix of activity to reflect better what is working. Moreover, looking at competitor analysis to understand why their customer signed up for their services rather than yours can only be helpful in increasing acquisition rates as when you comprehend why some people prefer your rivals, you can take action to try and draw them to signing up to you instead.</p>\n\n<p>Think about scheduling. TV companies wouldn\'t dream of devising their schedules without reference to the likely programming of their rivals. Bringing as much data about customer behavior as possible into concise and up-to-date reports means all aspects of OTT can be tweaked to attract more customers. If only 5% of customers mention your poorly performing sports channels, but 39% enthuse about your Bollywood channel you may decide to abandon your sports coverage and look at new ways of upselling your Bollywood content, such as a premium service for new releases. Or, vice-versa. It\'s about looking beyond just the TV data to see what the whole picture.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 57, 6);

INSERT INTO `aldryn_newsblog_article_translation` VALUES (65, 'en', 'TV Advertisers Need Better Audience Segments', 'tv-advertisers-better-audience-segments', '<p>With online segments overlaid on linear schedules, many are hoping for a golden age of TV advertising, where brands can break out beyond the demographics used for linear audiences, such as \"truck intenders\" and \"parents with children.”</p>\n\n<p>However, little time has been spent considering where these segments come from and whether the quality is good enough for TV.</p>\n\n<p>If marketers are running pay-per-click campaigns online, the quality of their audiences is less relevant because they are only paying for people who click. The presence of riff-raff on their lists has almost no impact. But when the same segments are used to map target audiences to TV advertising, the errant members of the list drive the media plan equally as much as the list’s valid members.</p>\n\n<p>On TV, the effective cost of the campaign is directly influenced by segment quality. Hence, media planners need to focus on the purity and accuracy of the segments they use. Just mapping what they have applied to digital campaigns can be highly problematic.</p>\n\n<p>The value of online segments is derived from both the quality of the segment and the reach. Gradations of quality are acceptable if ROI can be proven.</p>\n\n<p>In TV, you do not need segment reach as TV already gives you reach. You do need the highest-quality segments. As an industry, we have spent much time validating viewing data from set-top-boxes and smart TVs, but we now need to take a much closer look at the audience segments that we are matching to these viewing data sets.</p>\n\n<p>Most online segments come from online activities, with a probabilistic measure of a consumer\'s attributes. For example, we might have a set of cookies from people who have recently purchased diapers online. With a high probability, we can assert that these cookies belong to parents with children. With a lower but still high confidence, we can argue that they are likely to be mothers of children.</p>\n\n<p>To build reach online, data brokers will take the segment that starts off with diaper buyers, market it as \"parents with children\" and then ratchet up the lookalike model to get as many people with similar behavioral characteristics. That lookalike model might be conservative (narrower) or aggressive (broader), depending on the product and the economics of conversion.</p>\n\n<p>The broker then sells that segment with a good reach among the target segment online. By the time modeling has been done, the segment – “parents with children” – might be 20 times the size of the original seed of recent diaper buyers.</p>\n\n<p>If the same segment is used on TV, the buyer matches the cookies to TV viewing to pull the linear spots that index highly for that segment. However, because the broker has diluted the segment to give reach, buyers will get a much less tightly focused set of spots than if they were just looking at the primary data.</p>\n\n<p>To be effective on TV, segments need to have the most distinctive characteristics to bring out the most strongly differentiated programming in the indexing model. “Recent diaper buyers” are perfect for a Pampers campaign but of limited use for other parenting campaigns.</p>\n\n<p>TV has become the lifeblood of brand advertising precisely because it provides reach. Audience-based, data-driven TV enables advertisers to focus that reach on more targeted audiences. However, to do this well, media buyers need to start asking questions about segment provenance and drive transparency in the data sets they are purchasing.</p>\n\n<p>First, buyers need to know precisely how the segment was sourced. Does it come from cookies or actual PII-tracked activity? What is the action that caused the user to be included in the segment? And how many different data sets have been combined to make it?</p>\n\n<p>Second, buyers need to know if a lookalike model was used to expand the size of the segment. If the source data set is too small to be matched against TV, then chances are that adding a lookalike will make the situation worse.</p>\n\n<p>By holding brokers and data providers to account, buyers can be sure that the data they are getting is the right size and shape to fuse to TV. Data needs to be high-quality on both sides of the process – viewing data and audience data.</p>\n\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://adexchanger.com/tv-and-video/tv-advertisers-need-better-audience-segments/\">AdExchanger</a></em></p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'https://adexchanger.com/tv-and-video/tv-advertisers-need-better-audience-segments/', 0, 65, 6);

INSERT INTO `aldryn_newsblog_article_translation` VALUES (67, 'en', 'Streamlining Data Operations on AWS', 'streamlining-data-operations-aws', '<p>With increasing demand for data engineers, it is becoming harder to recruit staff who can manage and support a data pipeline. Although cloud providers like AWS have simplified the technical operations such as managing servers and hosting facilities, the day to day operations of managing data remain. These include verifying data receipt, checking data issues, escalating to data suppliers where needed, perfecting data storage, and ensuring users can query the data efficiently.</p>\n\n<p>These tasks are non-core to most organizations, but they are a critical hygiene factor to building a modern data-driven organization. At Deductive, we run data operations for companies at scale. We have developed a specialist team and toolset for monitoring and managing data infrastructure on AWS, and in this article, we explain our approach to data operations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-is-data-operations\">What is data operations?</h2>\n\n<p>AWS gives fully managed infrastructure for data. From data collection with Kinesis to data warehousing on Redshift and data lakes on S3 and Amazon Athena, it is an impressively comprehensive toolset. However, although Amazon gives a fully managed service for the infrastructure they do not offer the data operations to ensure that the data flows smoothly and is usable by staff. To ensure that data flows smoothly, we need management across four different areas: data ingest, data health, data storage, and data security.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\" Data Operations and Data Pipeline\" src=\"https://static.deductive.com/img/data-pipeline-ops.png\"></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"monitoring-data-ingest\">Monitoring data ingest</h3>\n\n<p>Data ingestion on AWS is typically implemented using Lambda functions, bespoke python scripts, CRON jobs on EC2, AWS Batch, and direct access to S3 buckets by third parties. To verify the flow of data through into these platforms, we have developed a tool, the <a href=\"/tools/pipeline-api/\">Pipeline API</a>, that will confirm all incoming data and apply data filtering, alerting, tokenization, and monitoring. This checks can include whether the data is coming in on time; if it is correct and well formed; and whether it is of the right size.</p>\n\n<p>If data is stored in S3, the <a href=\"/tools/pipeline-api/\">Pipeline API</a> can be implemented merely by opening access to the S3 bucket to the Pipeline API. Once the monitoring is in place, our team will watch for the first weeks the state of the data coming in and build rules on how the data should be confirmed. Once these rules are set up and agreed, the team can investigate and escalate when data does not meet specifications.</p>\n\n<p>The level of activity at this stage can vary from characterizing the problem and escalating to the in-house team through to end to end debugging and working with third-party suppliers to resolve the issue.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"data-health\">Data health</h3>\n\n<p>Most data platforms do not always have perfect data, and it\'s essential for data analysts and data scientists to be aware of where there might be issues with the data. As part of a data operations service, we will typically provide a data health dashboard that can be implemented into reporting tools like Tableau to give the entire organization with a single view of the health of the data in the data lake.</p>\n\n<p>Such a dashboard covers how recently the data sources were updated, if there were outages and days where data is missing, or if there are issues only with some specific fields from a data provider. This granular view of data health is critical to building trust in data across the organization. Mainly where datasets have been unreliable in the past, it can be slow to establish credibility amongst data scientists who will often stick to data they know rather than adopt new data sets that they are concerned might not be correct.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\" Data Health Dashboard\" src=\"https://static.deductive.com/img/data-health.jpg\"></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"optimizing-data-storage\">Optimizing Data Storage</h3>\n\n<p>Although AWS has fully managed storage on AWS, there are complexities to both S3 and Redshift that need significant trade-offs between performance availability, and cost, and each of these services requires pro-active management on the data level to ensure performance at scale.</p>\n\n<p>For S3 we can ensure that the most cost-effective availability zones are used as the data grows. We can set-up proper transformations for incoming data needs in different file size or format for best querying on security reasons. For example, some information is best saved as small gzip files when others perform better as larger parquet files. We can also maximize query performance of Athena catalogs so that internal data science teams can focus on data science rather than fiddling with the data structures.</p>\n\n<p>For Redshift, we give a full DBA service. This service includes checking queries and optimizing them for your users daily. Our standard is to ensure that they all run in less than 5 minutes, and we find this is realistic for over 95% of queries on most datasets, even when using the lower cost Redshift options. Our data engineering team will propose and implement schema updates to optimize cost and performance, including dropping data to S3 and accessing it through Redshift Spectrum where necessary. We will also handle all regular maintenance jobs such as vacuum and encoding updates.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"data-security\">Data Security</h3>\n\n<p>Ensuring data is secure requires regular updates to be sure that only necessary data is loaded into the platform, it is just retained for as long as it is needed, and that only authorized people access, and that they can only access it for purposes that the owners of the data have given consent.</p>\n\n<p>The services we include under data operations are particular and limited only to a small subset of data security, but they are also four areas that are typically not well served by broader data security initiative. Firstly, we audit data access. AWS provides the tools to record all data access, but the results can be hard to interpret. We assemble this into a profile for each user and report on it at a summary level. Unusual behavior is flagged up for investigation.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, we will audit personally identifiable information (PII) to ensure that it is stumble tokenized or anonymized at all stages and that only authorized users have access to the untokenized data. If a data provider starts including PII where they had not previously provided it, your data lake can quickly become a liability.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we can implement the “right to be forgotten” process that is mandated under GDPR. For this, all records relating to an individual need to be deleted from data platforms, and across any third parties where data has been sent. With extensive data stores across S3 and Redshift, this can be a lengthy task and is well suited for outsourcing.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"in-house-or-outsource\">In-house or outsource?</h2>\n\n<p>On AWS, it is straightforward to build out a data platform that can efficiently scale rapidly, but it does need pro-active management. Rather than dedicating valuable internal resources to data operations, many companies are looking to outsource data operations.</p>\n\n<p>In part, because it is the kind of activity that benefits from a diversity experience. At Deductive, we process many different data types, and our data engineering has more experience with many of the operational issues than most in-house teams. Data operations also benefit from economies of scale. We can afford to have a team that is continuously learning all the new tools and services available from AWS. This can be hard for many internal teams to keep up with.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, there are few off-the-shelf tools available for data operations. Our investment in the <a href=\"/tools/pipeline-api/\">Pipeline API</a> has been driven by our need for tools we can use when we run data pipelines for our clients. Only the right combination of skills, tools, and experience can make data operations efficient, and that either requires enough scale to build a strong data operations team in-house or an experienced partner to outsource to.</p>\n\n<p>Increasingly, we are finding companies are turning to us to help.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 67, 30);

We’ve analyzed set-top-box data to see that it fills in a lot of the gaps that aren’t covered by panel data. Now we’ve got smart TV data from Inscape, and we\'ve been comparing their data with set-top-box and panel data to see how they stack up together.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-did-we-compare-it\">How did we compare it?</h2>\n\n<p>Nielsen publishes regular ratings, as do the set-top-box vendors, providing estimated national percentages of homes tuning in to shows. We calculated the same metrics using Inscape\'s data on a DMA by DMA basis and then normalizing it up to be nationally representative.</p>\n\n<p>The chart below shows 15-minute ratings for two local affiliate networks in a small DMA. We chose these because they are areas where there are a minimal number of panelists available and few set-top-boxes from MVPDs who share their data. It\'s a classic case where the smart TV data should be able to show divergence from the norm.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Comparing Smart TV data, panel data, and set-top-box data\" src=\"https://static.deductive.com/img/inscape-panel-stb.png\"></p>\n\n<p>What\'s interesting here is just how well the smart TV data tracks against both the panel data and the set-top-box data. There is more variability on both of the other datasets, which we\'d expect based on the sample size, but overall we were impressed at consistent the datasets were.</p>\n\n<p>We also found it interesting that the smart TV data didn\'t need anywhere near the level of modeling that we\'d need to perform if we were dealing with raw set-top-box or panel data. By just applying simple arithmetic we can generate numbers that not only correlated well with the other data sets but provided very similar overall results.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"so-what-gaps-does-smart-tv-data-fill\">So what gaps does smart TV data fill?</h2>\n\n<p>One of the most significant benefits of Inscape\'s data is that it\'s independent of the TV ecosystem. Nielsen is paid for by the networks. MVDPs pay the channels for their programming. Except for the influence of Netflix - whose app is more important than any other feature on the smart TV - the TV manufacturers are entirely independent of the networks and the MVPDs. MVPD’s won’t release granular information on viewing that will affect their carriage deal negotiations, and Nielsen is unlikely to adopt a methodology which would lead to a decline in the big four networks.</p>\n\n<p>Only the Smart TV manufacturers are independent arbiters of what people are watching on their screens, and agencies, in particular, can trust that.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"smart-tvs-know-what-is-on-display\">Smart TVs know what is on display.</h2>\n\n<p>The big dirty secret about set-top-box data is that nobody knows whether there’s a TV connected to the end of the set-top-box and whether it’s switched on. If a family sits down and watches CBS all evening, or switches the TV off after the evening news, the set-top-box signal looks the same.</p>\n\n<p>For sure, we don’t know whether anyone is actually in the room, or whether they’ve fallen asleep with the TV on, but we do know that it’s tuned in and there’s sound blaring out into the room.</p>\n\n<p>Inscape\'s smart TV data gives us a breakdown by the input of the TV, so we not only know whether the TV was switched on, but we know if it had a set-top-box or a broadcast antenna attached, and we exactly know what was on the screen at that time.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"we-can-match-on-ip-address\">We can match on IP address</h2>\n\n<p>Panel data’s unique selling point is also its Achilles heel: it tells you precisely who’s pressed a button on a people meter to say who’s watching the show at that time. At one fell swoop, this solves the problem of whether the set-top-box has a TV connected to it and whether there is anyone in the room. At the same time, it limits the number of people you can measure to those who are willing to press a button, and it restricts what you can do with them.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the internet - which now accounts for more advertising than TV - is based on building up profiles of behaviors from different data sources and fusing them together. Panel data is horrible to combine because of the tiny number of panelists. Set-top-box data is often limited in how we can join it because of both the Cable Act and also the reticence of MVPD’s to share data on their subscribers.</p>\n\n<p>Smart TV data has no such limitation, and with an active opt-in from consumers, granular viewing data is available tied to IP address which we can quickly match to online cookie pools.</p>\n\n<p>The IP address takes us beyond the simple segmentation that we can do with Nielsen market break segments to direct fusion from brands first-party data and custom audiences from online DSPs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-future-of-tv-data\">The future of TV data</h2>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the best dataset depends on the application for which you are using it.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve seen people combining smart TV data with first-party data to provide attribution and conversion metrics against tightly defined segments. We’ve seen people using smart TV data on its own for multi-platform tune-in. We’ve seen others stick with panel data.</p>\n\n<p>Those who want the best granularity, are combining all of your datasets into a single pool. Set-top-box data is the best way to understand how people are engaging with the TV when they lean forward to grab that remote. Smart TV data is the best dataset for the overall viewing experience and matching data online. Panel data is necessary if you need to precisely know who is in the same room as the TV.</p>\n\n<p>Which dataset you use depends entirely on your use case. Smart TV data matches well against both set-top-box and panel data, and its granularity and speed opens up a new set of use cases that we can’t address with set-top-box data or panel data alone.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 69, 8);
INSERT INTO `aldryn_newsblog_article_translation` VALUES (70, 'en', 'Data science needs data operations to make it work', 'data-science-needs-data-operations', '<p>Our passion is putting data to work: the strategy about what you should do; the science behind how you can do it; and then the engineering to turn it into a reality. It\'s once we\'ve completed the build out of a data pipeline, the hard work of operating the platform kicks in.</p>\n\n<p>The difficulty of running a data pipeline isn\'t in the management of the servers or ensuring there\'s enough capacity. Both of those are nowadays handled by AWS. This tricky part is in making sure that the data that\'s going into the pipeline arrives promptly, meets specifications, and is fit for purpose.</p>\n\n<p>Most data pipelines have somewhere between 10 and 100 different data source arriving regularly. Some arrive in real-time, some hourly, most will come daily, and others will come less frequently. Where it gets complicated is that some datasets need to get processed in a specific order. If you\'re getting a set of ad impressions inbound that you want to match against your latest campaign database, you need to make sure your campaign data has arrived BEFORE you start loading your ad impressions. Validating that the data comes in the right order is the first step in any data operations center.</p>\n\n<p>The second step is ensuring that data meets the specifications that we\'ve defined. Simply speaking, if we\'re expecting a UTF-8 encoded JSON file, are we receiving a UTF-8 encoded JSON file? It\'s all too frequent that non-English characters and unexpected quotation marks to break both UTF-8 and JSON, making the data unreadable to downstream ingest processes.</p>\n\n<p>Once we\'ve validated each file, we need the same level of sense checking for each field. If there are dates in the data, are they well formatted and are they in the expected date range? Are all strings within the expected length? Do numeric fields have the right distribution? All of these field level checks are critical to ensuring that data providers are delivering consistent data.</p>\n\n<p>Once we\'re confident that the data meets the specification we still have to ensure that it\'s fit for purpose. If we usually receive a 3Mb file from a customer and one day we get 43Gb, then we can guess they\'ve sent us the wrong file. If we typically take data from 45 different campaigns and one day we only receive data for 43, we know that something has gone wrong with those other two campaigns.</p>\n\n<p>Once we\'ve validated that all the data is correct, we automatically load it into the pipeline. The manually intensive work of data operations is in dealing with data that\'s failed validation. We typically separate this data out into quarantine and from there we manually examine it to understand what\'s gone wrong, discussing with the data provider, and working to get correct data. If we can, we\'ll manually correct the data to keep it flowing, but ultimately the goal is to get each data provider to take responsibility for delivering data correctly.</p>\n\n<p>In the overall life-cycle of the data, getting it into the data lake or data warehouse is only really the starting point, and data operations also has a significant role to play in making sure that users can make the most of the data. When it comes to querying big datasets, 90% of the performance issues come from users\' not knowing the best way to work with the data. Data operations need to keep a close eye on user activities: looking for slow queries from users and potential bottlenecks reading data. We operate a daily process to review the time-consuming tasks and proactively reach out to users with ways to improve the performance. When this approach was rolled out with one of our clients, we saw an average improvement of query time from 10 minutes down to less than 1 minute across the board.</p>\n\n<p>None of these activities are particularly difficult, and many are merely the systematic application of common sense. However, when they are all applied to data operations, the results are spectacular. Getting operations right enables analysts and data scientists to spend less time on data preparation and focus more of their time adding dollars to the bottom line. That\'s why data science needs data operations.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 70, 26);

They asked our data science consulting team to look at the TV data and quality-of-service information they were collecting to drive a strategy to improve service retention.</p>\n\n<p>Most OTT services struggle with retention when they launch, and the metric of 35% retained users is similar to a benchmarks we see for a lot of our customers. However, it was apparent that the operator’s issue was partly a problem of its own making: they had fallen into the trap of applying old Pay TV logic to a new OTT service.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than starting from scratch, they\'d taken their existing retention process and had only loosely adapted for OTT. It\'s easy to take into account a few differences between the two, such as cancellation windows, but we’ve seen time and again that this approach doesn’t work. OTT is fundamentally different to Pay TV and operators need an entirely new playbook to retain their customers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ripping-up-the-rules-and-starting-again\">Ripping up the rules and starting again</h2>\n\n<p>Our data science consulting team took the customer through our standard procedure for retention projects. We ingested six months’ worth of OTT TV data (consumption and quality of service) and mapped it to CRM data, and some first-party data that the client had access to. We excluded data which we knew was subject to data quality issues.</p>\n\n<p>Our data science consulting team carried out a series of reporting and modeling of customers that had churned and customers that had not, and analyzed the essential characteristics and differences between the two. They found critical identifiers of churn amongst the OTT base including content, billing, and quality factors.</p>\n\n<p>The team then built a predictive model that helped to identify customers who were most likely to churn, and worked on an overall strategy to reduce churn within the business, including the integration of our model into existing operational systems, and training the customer’s analytics team to run and iterate the model themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we created a series of dashboards to demonstrate and monitor some of the churn triggers we wanted to show the customer.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"getting-to-the-nub-of-the-problem\">Getting to the nub of the problem</h2>\n\n<p>The reporting and modeling revealed some easy wins that the customer could quickly implement. One was changing the time frame around which the business looked at churn. With its core TV service, the customer’s retention strategy worked by identifying potential churners 12 weeks before they disconnected the service. It was quickly evident that OTT customers were more impulsive in deciding to churn, so we built the model around this shorter time frame.</p>\n\n<p>We also added credit card expiration to the factors that exhibited churn in the model, as this was a cause of far more service disconnections than was the case for the customer’s core TV service.</p>\n\n<p>We undertook programme-level analysis to understand which content indexed particularly well on the OTT service. This uncovered niche programming that performed well on the platform, but whose strong performance was masked by hit programming that inevitably had more views. One such example was wrestling, which, while having a small audience, had a very dedicated one for OTT, and indexed highly on the service</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Genres from TV Data\" src=\"https://static.deductive.com/img/frequency-intensity.png\"></p>\n\n<p>Some factors in the model were down-weighted. The operator had thought that customers who watched a lot of live content were less likely to churn. In fact, this data was biased by viewers watching a few major seasonal events, and some customers who took the service to view these events were more likely to churn, rather than less.</p>\n\n<p>We also integrated quality of service data into the model. The company had used call center records and faults as a proxy for quality of service. We introduced real QoS data and analyzed the point at which a customer was more likely to churn if a particular element – buffering, start-up time, hit a certain level</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"giving-subscribers-some-love\">Giving subscribers some love</h2>\n\n<p>Our work contributed to a 10-percentage point improvement in retention rates for the OTT service. OTT TV data from the model we built has been integrated into the customer’s outbound communications systems, allowing the customer to react more quickly to signs that a subscriber may be leaving. Whenever a subscriber trials the OTT service, they are placed in one of several segments and marketed to accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>We can\'t take full credit for the improvement in the retention rate, but the client is convinced that data science is a critical factor in their success and is now working to personalize further what each subscriber receives and to send them even more relevant content and offer triggers.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 73, 1);

They know, within a few months of a customer joining, to which segment of users they belong. They know how to target them and at what time to upsell them to other products. And they know when customers are most likely to churn, and what to do to stop that from happening.</p>\n\n<p>But when it comes to OTT services, the playbook can be empty. The kind of content that watched on OTT differs from their core services. Quality of service expectations vary. Acquisition, retention, and upsell are very different for a month-by-month service that costs $10 a month than for a $100 monthly service with a 12-month minimum contract. And when service providers use OTT to take their content outside of their traditional markets or geographies it opens up a whole new set of parameters.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"making-sense-of-ott\">Making sense of OTT</h2>\n\n<p>We worked with a client that had launched a stand-alone OTT service in their local market, and in several markets outside their home territory.

We analyzed each part, classified the usage and analyzed the data to provide specific and actionable recommendations on how to better target each group.</p>\n\n<p>Combining what we saw from the TV data, our knowledge of our client\'s strategy, and benchmarketing from other operators, we came up with recommendations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-to-make-friends-and-influence-people-ott-style\">How to make friends and influence people, OTT-style</h2>\n\n<p>The segmentation surfaced eight distinct groups of OTT users. Some of these were segments that the client immediately recognized and expected to exist. There was a large group of users who were relatively new to the service and watched it only lightly. These users were the most critical to retain because they were also the ones who were most likely to stop using the service. The client used the model to target offers, using content touchpoints that particularly resonated with this segment, rather than those that were popular across the rest of the customer base.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Data science segments\" src=\"https://static.deductive.com/img/viewing-time-of-day.png\"></p>\n\n<p>Another segment was driven heavily by live events. Viewers were using the service to catch up on content that they would otherwise have missed by being away from the main set. The client created a campaign designed to improve the engagement of this segment of users, highlighting \"unmissable content.\"</p>\n\n<p>Two segments were heavily sport-focused. The client used the segmentation to communicate with its sports-based differently. One portion was a much lighter user of the service, and more at risk of churning. The client communicated with this segment by reinforcing the core, showpiece events that were available on the service. It targeted heavier users with non-sports content, to try and broaden the appeal of the service for this segment beyond just sports.</p>\n\n<p>We also identified a “Pay-TV-like” segment – customers who, based on the data, were using the service in a set-top box-like way, with a mix of content genres, and a combination of live and on-demand viewing. This segment was also affluent, and loyal. The customer agreed with our assessment and attempted to upsell this group to the core, and more profitable, Pay TV service.</p>\n\n<p>The final segment watched the service heavily on connected TVs and large-screen devices. This group was less affluent and lighter viewers, so were deemed a less relevant target for upgrading to the core service. They were instead targetied with offers around transactional movies, as the segment over-indexed in the viewing of both the core movie channels and transactional VoD.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-good-looks-like\">What good looks like</h2>\n\n<p>Before we rolled out our recommendations to the entire based, we tested them on a group of subscribers.

With the massive data sets now available from set-top-box and smart TV data providers, tune-in is becoming an everyday part of campaign planning and measurement.</p>\n\n<p>But as networks start to run cross-platform campaigns, buying on digital and addressable TV, as well as linear TV, it becomes harder attribute uplift to a specific market channel, let alone when we want to drill down to the separate lift in OTT and VOD viewing.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ve helped many clients set-up their multi-touch attribution process. In this article, we\'re going to outline the process that we used to do this for a client.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"starting-with-the-tv-data\">Starting with the TV data</h2>\n\n<p>For any closed-loop attribution activity for TV marketing, networks will have access both campaign exposure data, and conversion data, from multiple different sources. For tune-in, both the linear campaign data and the conversion data will typically come from the same source.</p>\n\n<p>For this specific project, the client was running a campaign across linear TV, addressable TV, and digital. For the digital campaign, they received IP address logs from a tracking pixel. For addressable, they had reported impressions from the MPVD running the ads, and for linear, they were using Smart TV data.</p>\n\n<p>Each of these datasets had only a partial view of the campaign and in some cases a partial view of the market. The smart TV data only covered a subset of the homes exposed to the commercials. The addressable data and digital data should both be complete datasets. Because the MVDP provided just aggregate statistics for the addressable ads, we could not directly match this data together, but we could match the Smart TV viewing along with the digital exposure using the IP address.</p>\n\n<p>The raw data that we started with once the campaign had run was as follows:</p>\n\n<table>\n	<thead>\n		<tr>\n			<th> </th>\n			<th> </th>\n		</tr>\n	</thead>\n	<tbody>\n		<tr>\n			<td>Smart TVs that saw the promo</td>\n			<td>61,127</td>\n		</tr>\n		<tr>\n			<td>Smart TVs that tuned into the show</td>\n			<td>25,597</td>\n		</tr>\n		<tr>\n			<td>Digital uniques</td>\n			<td>3,619,017</td>\n		</tr>\n		<tr>\n			<td>Addressable uniques</td>\n			<td>505,673</td>\n		</tr>\n	</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2 id=\"uplift-and-effectiveness\">Uplift and effectiveness?</h2>\n\n<p>Taking the 25,597 Smart TVs that had viewed the show, we ran an IP match against the digital data. Of these Smart TVs, we matched 58% to an online identifier that we could match against the digital campaign.</p>\n\n<p>With this in hand, our data science consulting team broke down the campaign into four different segments. People exposed to linear TV only, just addressable TV, digital only, linear TV and addressable TV, and those who saw the ad on both linear TV and digital.</p>\n\n<p>With these figures in hand we were able to model the conversion rate, uplift, and effectiveness of each of these channels:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Customer engagement\" src=\"https://static.deductive.com/img/multi-touch-table.png\"></p>\n\n<p>The tune-in rate is the overall percentage of national exposures that then went on to tune in to the show. The uplift is the number of additional households that tuned in they saw the commercial. The effectiveness index is a measure of probability. It describes how much more likely people who saw the commercial are to tune in compared with those who didn\'t see the commercial.</p>\n\n<p>As we can see a significant uplift in viewing based on the campaign, it is simple to calculate the return-on-investment, but of course what the client now wants to know is how to make it more efficiently next time?</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"so-whats-the-best-approach\">So what\'s the best approach?</h2>\n\n<p>When our data science consulting team plotted the reach vs. the effectiveness of the different media, they saw a distinct difference between the number of people reached with each media type against the effectiveness of the campaign.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Customer engagement\" src=\"https://static.deductive.com/img/multi-touch-chart.png\"></p>\n\n<p>These results suggest the most effective approach is to target people on both linear and addressable, but because of the low availability of addressable inventory, this only gives us limited reach and is thus hard to use to scale a campaign. Both linear and digital on their own provide scale but at the cost of lower effectiveness. The sweet spot between reach and efficiency comes from a combination of both digital and linear.</p>\n\n<p>These conclusions are of course only valid for this specific campaign, and as more addressable inventory becomes available, we would expect it to grow in importance.

Of all methodologies, this is the one with the lowest bar for a viewer to be included. I may only have had to watch half an episode of Real Housewives Of New Jersey to be in a segment of viewers who this show reached.</p>\n\n<p>This creates large audiences, which lend themselves to any use case around monetizing audiences - such as matching your TVs and set-top box audience to online cookies - or where a network is rewarded based on the size of the segment it delivers. We\'ve <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://adexchanger.com/tv-and-video/tv-advertisers-need-better-audience-segments/\">made the argument that segments can be problematic</a> from a quality point of view - but for any advertiser looking for reach, this is the best way to do it.</p>\n\n<p>This method is also great at targeting viewers on your network, but less so when modeling an audience on a 3rd party network. If you are building an audience using a lookalike model, you need attributes that you can use to find that audience elsewhere, but these qualities will be diluted if you use a reach-based method.

It\'s not valid to compare the reach of NCIS, which has multiple hour-long episodes of a given week, and a limited series like Baskets. NCIS is always going to have a higher reach because it\'s airs more frequently. However, that doesn\'t mean that people prefer it to Baskets.</p>\n\n<p>Looking at those who <a href=\"/blogs/data-science-audience-indexing-tv-data/#method-2-top-viewers-who-watched-more-than-average\">watched more than the average viewer</a> allows for more meaningful comparisons between a much broader range of shows. The same goes for popularity; this method will enable you to compare a niche show and a hit show more fairly.</p>\n\n<p>The issue with using watched more than average is that it will over-index on viewers who watch a lot of TV. Let\'s imagine we are looking for people who index heavily on two big shows - say, This Is Us and The Big Bang Theory. People who watch a lot of TV are very likely to watch both shows, and you will end up with a segment that is large, but probably not very distinctive. They may have watched these shows a lot, but they probably watched lots of other shows a lot as well.</p>\n\n<p>This methodology produces better results if you are creating a mass market segment, and one that you think watches a lot of TV. Think older demographics, homemakers, etc. It works less well with harder-to-reach audiences, or for less favorite shows.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"finding-the-biggest-fans\">Finding the biggest fans</h2>\n\n<p>If you want to feed your segments into a lookalike model, for example, to sell TV audiences online, then you need to create the most distinctive set of TV viewers you can get.</p>\n\n<p>You can do this by mining viewing data for the <a href=\"/blogs/data-science-audience-indexing-tv-data/#method-4-biggest-fans-who-has-the-show-in-their-top-list\">biggest fans of each show</a>. This methodology produces smaller audiences, but is another excellent filter for finding a show\'s most loyal audience. It is particularly useful for creating segments of shows that may not be highly rated, but that have exceptionally loyal audiences, or for shows or channels that tend to attract lighter TV viewers.</p>\n\n<p>It also accounts for viewers who may be heavy viewers of a specific show, but who are light TV viewers overall, more than the other methodologies. Inclusion in this segment is based purely on a viewer\'s preference - and doesn\'t take into account their overall viewing.</p>\n\n<p>This methodology also creates the most distinctive segments of the four methods, and you will get much less overlap between segments, making this segment the most effective for inclusion in a lookalike model, or for fusion modeling.</p>\n\n<p>We\'d also using this approach to identify shows and programs which have small but loyal audiences.

The trade-off is that query times are longer, but for these proof-of-concept systems, this is not a problem.</p>\n\n<p>To use Redshift Spectrum for ELT, we\'d replace the staging tables in the database with a Spectrum schema. In theory Redshift Spectrum should allow us to streamline this process by no longer needing to load data physically into the staging tables.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Amazon Redshift Spectrum pipeline architectures\" src=\"https://static.deductive.com/img/spectrum-etl.png\"></p>\n\n<p>In practice, everything depends on the query performance of Spectrum compared to loading the data into Redshift in the traditional manner.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"testing-redshift-spectrum-performance\">Testing Redshift Spectrum performance</h2>\n\n<p>Amazon gives some guidance on optimizing data to improve Redshift Spectrum performance so we decided to isolate some of these factors and test them individually to see how close we could push the performance to match that of the same data loaded directly into Redshift. Amazon recommendations include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>Using Parquet formatted data files.</li>\n	<li>Keeping file sizes between 100 MB and 1 GB.</li>\n	<li>Using the fewest columns possible in queries.</li>\n	<li>Writing SQL that uses filters and aggregations that are eligible to be pushed to the Redshift Spectrum layer.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All of our queries comply with the last two points, so we concentrated on investigating file format and file size against dataset size. As we are looking to using Redshift spectrum for ELT, it is effectively acting as a staging area for smaller datasets which means that the number of rows involved is only the batch size loaded at any one time, typically up to around 5 million rows.</p>\n\n<p>We therefore tested the following scenarios:</p>\n\n<table>\n	<thead>\n		<tr>\n			<th>Type</th>\n			<th>Parameters</th>\n		</tr>\n	</thead>\n	<tbody>\n		<tr>\n			<td>File format</td>\n			<td>- Raw CSV</td>\n		</tr>\n		<tr>\n			<td> </td>\n			<td>- GZip compressed</td>\n		</tr>\n		<tr>\n			<td> </td>\n			<td>- Parquet formatted</td>\n		</tr>\n		<tr>\n			<td>File size</td>\n			<td>- Small - below 100MB</td>\n		</tr>\n		<tr>\n			<td> </td>\n			<td>- Medium - above 100MB but below 1GB</td>\n		</tr>\n		<tr>\n			<td>Dataset size</td>\n			<td>- Small - approx 35,000 rows, 15 columns (VARCHARs and INTs)</td>\n		</tr>\n		<tr>\n			<td> </td>\n			<td>- Medium - approx 5,000,000 rows, 15 columns (VARCHARs and INTs)</td>\n		</tr>\n		<tr>\n			<td>Query complexity</td>\n			<td>- Simple1 - two columns, where clause selects ~90% of rows</td>\n		</tr>\n		<tr>\n			<td> </td>\n			<td>- Simple2 - two columns, where clause selects ~10% of rows</td>\n		</tr>\n		<tr>\n			<td> </td>\n			<td>- Complex1 - join, three columns, where clause selects ~90% of rows</td>\n		</tr>\n		<tr>\n			<td> </td>\n			<td>- Complex2 - join, three columns, where clause selects ~10% of rows</td>\n		</tr>\n	</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<h2 id=\"query-test-results\">Query test results</h2>\n\n<p>We loaded the test data directly into Redshift to give a baseline performance against which to normalize the rest of the results. We applied our test SQL to all the possible optimisation variants and tabulated the results. We ran all of the queries 100 times and averaged response times to minimize any short-term temporal effects such as cluster performance, code compilation or results caching:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Amazon Redshift data pipeline results\" src=\"https://static.deductive.com/img/redshift-spectrum-results.png\"></p>\n\n<p>The raw results can be downloaded <a href=\"/media/wp-content/uploads/redshift-spectrum-results.csv\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. The normalized values show the length of time a query took compared to the baseline (e.g., 2.0 means a Spectrum query took twice as long compared to the equivalent loaded data query or 200% of the time)</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusions\">Conclusions</h2>\n\n<p>Besides confirming that these optimisation techniques do work, the results held a few surprises for us. For instance, we didn\'t predict that file size would be far more significant than file format in affecting query times, so this is an easy win to improve performance. Also, changing the file format is only substantial for more massive datasets, meaning for our smaller Proof of Concepts there\'s no value in converting the data to Parquet.

Frequently - and particularly for tune-in - networks are looking for viewers that resonate strongly with particular types of programming.</p>\n\n<p>Now it might sound like a simple question, but in practice, there are many different ways to define how strongly viewers have an affinity with particular types of programming. Choosing the method you use will depend on what you are measuring and how you are going to use the audience. You can have groups that are broad, narrow, homogeneous, highly differentiated, and with high or low coverage of the content.</p>\n\n<p>Few people want low coverage, and most applications would ideally have a set that is both highly differentiated and have excellent coverage of both audience and content. Once we have our cake, we now want to eat it. But the algorithms we use for indexing have inherent trade-offs. As you can see in the chart below, we typically have a compromise between coverage of audience and coverage of content:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Methods to build target audiences from TV data\" src=\"https://static.deductive.com/img/indexing-methodologies.png\"></p>\n\n<p>Our data science consulting team has grouped the different algorithms we can use for audience indexing into five different categories and have outlined which ones are most effective, as well as how we calculate them. These algorithms don\'t just apply to tune-in, either. We can use similar methodologies to understand whether an audience indexes heavily towards renting Ford vehicles, listening to Pink Floyd, or more or less any activity where we have supporting data.</p>\n\n<p>This post covers each of these methods and guidance on the advantages and disadvantages of each method. To establish which is most appropriate, our data science consulting team typically creates groups using each approach and compares the outcomes. We examine how sharply they are differentiated from each other, their size, and the overall coverage of the universe of viewers that have been covered by the audiences.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"method-1-total-reach-who-watched-for-longer-than-x-minutes\">Method 1) Total reach: who watched for longer than X minutes?</h2>\n\n<p>Taking any viewers who watch the content for more than a certain threshold of time will produce a large group, but is a very blunt metric that tends to over-emphasize programming that is heavily repeated or unusually long, or with a lot of episodes.</p>\n\n<p>The code to calculate this in SQL is:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight\">\n<pre><span class=\"c1\">-- get all viewers who have watched the show with id show_id for more than 10 minutes</span>\n<span class=\"k\">SELECT</span> <span class=\"k\">DISTINCT</span> <span class=\"n\">viewer_id</span>\n<span class=\"k\">FROM</span> <span class=\"n\">viewing</span>\n<span class=\"k\">WHERE</span> <span class=\"n\">fk_show_id</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">show_id</span>\n<span class=\"k\">AND</span> <span class=\"n\">viewing_duration</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"mi\">10</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span> <span class=\"mi\">60</span>\n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>As a variant, it can be adjusted to consider what percentage of a particular show was watched rather than a fixed time.

It\'s not hard to see why. Some customers we work with consider data monetization to be something quite close to money for old rope - generating new revenue from information that an organization already has sitting in a database somewhere. It\'s more complicated than this of course, and the processes needed to turn this into something valuable for third parties is non-trivial (more on this later), but it\'s easy to see why the C-Suite is getting excited about it.</p>\n\n<p>What we often find when embarking on data monetization projects, is that we can make quicker and more substantial gains by taking that data sitting in a database somewhere, turning it into something usable for internal teams, and optimizing internal processes. In-house applications of data may not be as \"sexy\" as monetization but often delivers more on a dollars and cents basis.</p>\n\n<p>At Deductive, we often talk about \"big numbers\" when referring to data monetization. Most businesses we work with have a couple of significant numbers that are top of mind among most senior executives. For MVPDs and other subscription video businesses, the benefits come from churn (the number of customers that an operator loses on a quarterly or annual basis), or the what the platform has spent on the NFL, EPL or whatever other sports content drives subs in their market.</p>\n\n<p>For airlines, acquiring fleet is by far the most substantial use of CAPEX. From an operating perspective, labor and fuel are the most significant operating expenses (the latter not being something that an airline’s data science team can do a great deal about). But another crucial variable in running an airline is the proportion of time planes spend in the air, vs. on the ground. Airline profitability relies on planes being airborne for as long as possible, and not sitting on the ground, racking up airport fees.</p>\n\n<p>In both these examples - and, in most businesses, we come across - even a fractional improvement in these core metrics will increase by millions of dollars of profitability.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason, we always advise customers interested in data monetization also to starting by using data to improve their most important internal processes. Or to put it another way, be sure that everything possible is being done internally to use data to optimize whatever the key performance indicators are for their business.</p>\n\n<p>So which businesses should be looking at data monetization first? There are probably sectors that have historically invested more in using data to solve internal processes for whom external monetization is a natural next step. Hundreds of millions of data science working hours have been expending trying to keep airplanes in the air and off the ground for as long as possible, while the TV industry has only started scratching the surface of addressing churn using data.</p>\n\n<p>And there are some market size and positioning frameworks that can be used to understand whether data monetization is the right play to make for a company. Any company that is a market leader in its field (e.g., has access to a bulk of the transactions/customers/data in its industry), and where that area has no existing data offering, should probably be looking at data monetization regardless of how they use data internally. Companies, where the opposite is true, should think more carefully about external monetization.</p>\n\n<p>But in reality, the concept of internal and external monetization being an either/or decision is a misnomer. Most companies are doing both concurrently. Quite apart from anything else, we find that the technical and data engineering aspects of both - the data pipeline, storage, and warehousing, is often the same for both internal and external usage.</p>\n\n<p>If a marketing team in your organization wants to access data to optimize campaign planning, and a third party wants to obtain data to streamline some of their internal processes, both are customers of that data, and both will want broadly similar things. They will probably want same-day (or real-time) access to cleansed, accurate data, and to be able quickly to access the information they need. And both may wish to obtain one or a combination of raw data, a relational database or a dashboard, app or interface to do so. From the CIO’s point of view, any development in a company\'s data infrastructure should feed both these internal and external use cases.</p>\n\n<p>Data monetization is rightly something that excites the industry, but we always encourage customers to check that they are also doing everything possible to maximize the internal value of their data first.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 80, 6);

At the same time, the amount of census-based TV data has been exploding, and we expect 2018 to be the inflection point where dollars start shifting from Nielsen to other datasets.

Although many of our team do have PhDs and we do process many petabytes of data, there\'s another critical element of data science consulting that often gets missed.</p>\n\n<p>Take the example of customer retention: it continues to be the most significant driver for the uptake of data science consulting projects among subscription businesses. The mantra that it costs at least five times more to acquire a new customer than to retain your existing ones remains broadly correct for most companies.</p>\n\n<p>There’s something slightly intangible and almost “magical” about this kind of project – we are looking to accurately predict if a subscriber is going to churn or not and give operators the tools to do something about it.</p>\n\n<p>However, the reality is far from magical. When our data science consulting team build models that can help them to retain customers better, we interrogate granular viewing data mapped to any number of other fields, giving operators an entirely new way of looking at churn. As well as looking at traditional indicators of churn like the length of subscription and CRM data, operators have an entirely new lens through which to see the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Success primarily comes not from how sophisticated the algorithms are, but the amount and quality of data, and which features we extract from that dataset and feed into the model. Consider the features you might use to predict churn in a sizable western market and compare them to a smaller Asian market. In the west, we\'ll focus on billing information and rich CRM data. In Asia, CRM data is frequently less accurate, and targeting based on language and ethnicity is much more common.</p>\n\n<p>You also need to take into account the difference between customers. A large vertically integrated provider with multiple expensive sports and movie rights will need a very different model to an IPTV provider that is using TV specifically as a means to grow broadband and mobile subscribers. These two operators, even in the same market, need very different approaches to churn.</p>\n\n<p>An excellent exploratory analysis will point you in the right direction of subtle changes in behavior that indicate that a customer is likely to churn. It\'s never as simple as you may think. Every operator we have worked with thinks VoD is a good retention strategy. It isn’t always, and we’ve even found customers for whom users watching a lot of VoD is an indicator that they are more likely to leave the operator.</p>\n\n<p>The final preparatory action is data cleansing: Our data science consulting team probably spend 75% of their time cleaning and preparing data.

From addressable to custom linear audiences, many advertisers are now making use of targeted audiences on TV, sourced from online segments, first party, or second party datasets.</p>\n\n<p>It’s great that we can buy these audiences, but it’s important to understand they are often created only against a subset of the country. They might be based on subscribers to a particular MVPD, or visitors to an online website that has been matched against TVs. Although this isn’t a problem when we’re buying the campaign, it does means that when we measure it we’re missing the full picture of who we are reaching and how effective the campaign has been.</p>\n\n<p>This leads us to overestimate the effectiveness of some campaigns, and underestimate others. Without a full picture across the country, we don’t know which campaigns are working and our new audiences are not better than TGI segments.</p>\n\n<p>To get that full picture, we need to use data science to fuse together a patchwork of different datasets, each giving a partial view but together they make a whole. The mathematics of how we combine these datasets is a complicated, but it’s critical part of any attribution model.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"so-how-can-data-science-calibrate-for-1000-audiences\">So how can data science calibrate for 1000 audiences?</h2>\n\n<p>Traditional TV measurement representative panels work on a limited number of variables which they’ve calibrated for the TV universe. When we start to match in other target audiences, we are bringing in 1000s of new variables which we haven\'t controlled for, and we need to dynamically calibrate the results of each campaign accordingly.</p>\n\n<p>At a high level, the new segment is going to skew the audience according to two factors: what proportion of the country is in the segment and what percentage of our universe is in the target group? As a simple example, consider a campaign to promote Netflix subscriptions that we want to measure with Smart TV viewing data. People with connected Smart TVs are significantly more likely have Netflix subscriptions than most of the population as Netflix is one of the primary drivers of connecting smart TVs. When we measure ad impressions from the Smart TV data, we therefore need to calibrate this down to make it nationally representative.</p>\n\n<p>Say, for example, 90% of Smart TV owners have Netflix subscriptions, and only 30% of the country have Netflix subscriptions. In this case, we\'d need to weight down our campaign effectiveness measure by a factor of three.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"adjusting-for-a-single-variable\">Adjusting for a single variable</h2>\n\n<p>Many of the more extensive census datasets are highly nationally representative and only need to be calibrated on a single variable, most frequently geography.</p>\n\n<p>Here our data science conulting team will calculate viewership and conversions for each different segment, and then scale it up. Take an example based on gender. If we have a dataset where 60% of the audience is male, and 40% is female, we merely calculate % viewership and conversion rates for men and women separately and then adjust the male figure by 60/48 and the female by 52/40 to get a nationally representative figure.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to geography, it’s often more convenient to reduce the number of devices we include in our analysis to take only a few from each region. This ensures that the proportion from each area is nationally representative.</p>\n\n<p>Either way, we can relatively quickly make nationally representative calculations when we are only calibrating on one variable. When we have multiple variables in play, it all starts to get a lot more complicated.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"handling-multiple-variables\">Handling multiple variables</h2>\n\n<p>If we\'re dealing with skews in, say, ethnicity and geography, our data science consulting work out not only how to calibrate the number of devices in each geography, but also how many devices with each ethnicity should be available in each geography. For ethnicity, we can probably source this data from census information, but if we\'re fusing in third-party sources such as Truck Intenders, it becomes a much more complicated problem.</p>\n\n<p>Here we need to calculate what proportion in each geography should be Truck Intenders, so we have the correct number of devices in each geography and the right amount of Truck Intenders nationally.</p>\n\n<p>To calculate this, we use the same statistical methods that Nielsen and the market research companies use to create panels. We are establishing the specific characteristics that we want to calibrate for, and then calculating how many devices we need with each combination. For example, if we\'re calibrating for Truck Intenders, geography, ethnicity, and presence of children, we\'d need to calculate right down to how many devices should we have in Detroit with Hispanic ownership that have children and intend to buy a truck.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to create these weighting is to use a method called Iterative Proportional fitting, and there are several useful python libraries that we use when are building these models for our clients. The input to the model is the number of people we expect nationally to have each of these characteristics, the number of devices we have with each set, and the model then creates weighting factors that we need to apply to make our results representative.</p>\n\n<p>With this in place, we have created a virtual panel with our devices based on the specific characteristics we need to model. The virtual panel is nationally representative and within the margins of our sampling error, will produce the right results for any campaign we run.</p>\n\n<p>What\'s interesting is just how different the nationally representative results can be from the raw data once you start to overlay more than one distinct variable.

A subscriber who was a premium subscriber yesterday but not today was treated no differently to subscribers who had only just joined.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"technical-data-audit\">Technical data audit</h2>\n\n<p>With a detailed knowledge of what the business wanted to achieve, and where some of the data gaps might be, we then started to review the business’ technical set-up. A kick-off session with the data engineering team gave us in-depth knowledge of the business’ data architecture and set-up.</p>\n\n<p>We started with the database technologies used, systems that feed into and out of the warehouse; the volume of data stored and frequency of access; the amount of data stored and tools used for ETL, visualization, and reporting and data mining.</p>\n\n<p>Our data science consulting team then reviewed every element of the database structure: from the ingestion process, the cleansing process, looking at the transformation process, data storage, and database structure, and reviewing all reports.</p>\n\n<p>Comparing the processes against industry best practice and the experience of our team, it became clear that the client had problems with data quality. The data warehouse contained data without filtering for cleanliness, so quality and junk data were stored together with no way to tell them apart. There were also specific issues around content metadata, preventing the marketing team from carrying out granular content recommendations and segmented offers.</p>\n\n<p>We also found some technical \"quick-wins\" that could be implemented immediately. These included updating some of the sort keys for better performance, and providing the ability to create a summary and aggregate tables in the database, to aid overall performance. We also showed how several critical reports could be re-written so that they run more efficiently and quickly</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"bringing-it-all-together\">Bringing it all together</h2>\n\n<p>Before we undertook the project, they believed that they are two main problems. They knew there were lots of internal initiatives that needed to use data, but no real cohesiveness regarding a data strategy. They thought there was a misalignment between where the business wanted to go, and what was collected and what was stored in the data warehouse.</p>\n\n<p>Although these were broadly true, we found more specific and actionable items that provided immediate benefits and initiated longer terms projects in the other areas.</p>\n\n<p>The client could immediately implement the database optimizations and re-write the slowly performing reports. There is much less of a delay in getting reports to C-level executives, and members of the BI team whose time was spent creating worksheets have now been freed up to carry out more advanced analytics</p>\n\n<p>The historical infromation on subscribers is now incorporated into the data warehouse, and the team is now able to target upsell offers to different subscribers, based on how long they have used the service for, whether they have dipped in and out of the service in the past, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Customer loyalty and user retention have both improved as a direct result of the team having the ability to target offers accurately to different parts of its audience</p>\n\n<p>As a next stage, the client is looking to onboard competitive intelligence directly into their platforms and has commissioned the data cleansing and enhanced metadata projects to address the final points of the audit.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 84, 38);

INSERT INTO `aldryn_newsblog_article_translation` VALUES (86, 'en', 'What does GDPR mean for TV data analytics?', 'gdpr-tv-data-analytics', '<p>With most of the advanced advertising models based on set-top-box and smart TV data coming from the USA, many of them are going to need to be updated to account for the differing regulatory environment in Europe. Come May 2018 this is getting a further overhaul with the new General Data Protection Regulation “GDPR” that enhances consumer rights in many areas.</p>\n\n<p>There are eight critical parts of the regulations that will have a significant impact on business models relating to TV data, and we’ve outlined our primer on these below</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-right-to-be-informed\">The right to be informed</h2>\n\n<p>If you’re collecting data on consumers, you need to inform them what you are receiving, why you are harvesting it, what you are going to do with it, and with whom you’re going to share it. If you’re going to use it to measure viewing to fulfill the obligations of your content deals, you need to mention this to consumers here. If you’re going to be profiling people to optimize your marketing towards then, you need to specify it here. If you’re going to be sharing TV data with third parties to improve advertising, then you need explicit permission from consumers to do this.</p>\n\n<p>None of these should be controversial with most consumers, but it’s important to be clear precisely what you’re doing and with whom you might be sharing data.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-right-of-access\">The right of access</h2>\n\n<p>Consumers also get the right to be able to see any information you’re storing on them. In the same way services like Netflix and Amazon provide a full viewing history online or in the app, if you’re saving viewing information you need to be able to provide a way for consumers to access this. Some companies will implement this by a “contact us to receive your data” but this will be costly to service.</p>\n\n<p>We expect most customers to enable online access to data they store on their customers, partly driven by the next right, which is...</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-right-of-rectification\">The right of rectification</h2>\n\n<p>If consumers believe you are holding incorrect information, then they will get the right for this to be rectified. This part of the legislation originates from credit rating agencies where people have had credit refused because they share the same name with a known felon. In the TV environment, it does has some relevance. If a conservative politician has been watching late night television programmes of dubious morality, they may well want them erased from the viewing database. Under GDPR they now have the right to have this rectified.</p>\n\n<p>This right to rectify makes the most compelling case for online access to viewing information. If you don\'t provide a simple online interface where people can see what you\'ve stored about them, then it\'s hard to process any requests for rectification efficiently.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-right-of-erasure\">The right of erasure</h2>\n\n<p>Typically referred to as the “right to be forgotten” this just means that consumers can demand to have all information on them to be erased. It’s unclear to us whether the law will require this only to apply when a consumer cancels a service, or whether TV providers will be required to continue to provide services after deleting all historical information on consumers.</p>\n\n<p>One crucial point about the right to erasure and the right of rectification is that this applies not only to your own data stores, but also any to third parties that you’ve shipped data. Say you’ve sent TV data to a data brokerage who has shared it with 169 different online platforms. You need to be able to either delete or update the data stored by that data brokerage and all of their downstream clients.</p>\n\n<p>This is going to be a significant overhead, and we expect platforms will typically going implement this on a “deletion only” policy. Under \"deletion only\" any rectification will result in deletion of all data on that subscriber in third-party datasets. We expect the shipping of lists of IDs to delete will become an everyday part of data shipping.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-right-to-data-portability\">The right to data portability</h2>\n\n<p>We, consumers, are willing to share our data because we know it makes our TV service better. I get more targeted advertising, better marketing, and constant more relaxant to me. However, under the GDPR, this data belongs to me and when I cancel one subscription and switch to another one I have the right to take my viewing data with me and gather the same benefits of service on my new subscription platform.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, we expect this to require all providers to provide a simple way for customers to download all of their data in a simple format, and over time for providers to enable the upload of datasets from competing providers. We don’t expect this data transfer to be mandated as a simple switch as has been the case in mobile number portability, but we do expect that all providers will need to provide the download of data as a minimum</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-right-to-object\">The right to object</h2>\n\n<p>In most cases, the right to object is very similar to the right to rectify where consumers are not asking for inaccuracies to be corrected, but to oppose the holding of specific facts. For a credit rating company, this could amount to objecting about an old bankruptcy still being held on the record. For TV providers we expect this to be uncontroversial and rarely to apply.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rights-relating-to-automatic-decision-making-and-profiling\">Rights relating to automatic decision making and profiling</h2>\n\n<p>GDPR creates a class of new rights about profiling and a specific opt-out of automatic decision making. Anytime you are profiling consumers - for example, to provide enhanced advertising or marketing - you need to get explicit opt-in from consumers to do so, and consumers must have an option not to be affected by computer decision making.</p>\n\n<p>Although similar to the rights to be informed, it goes a step further where profiling is used to make decisions automatically. From eligibility for offers or targeted advertising, consumers need to be able to opt out. The intention of this is to prevent discrimination because of decisions made by computers.</p>\n\n<p>In a credit rating example, it means that consumers have the right to demand that the credit rating is performed manually by a human being rather than by a computer algorithm. Online, it means people are going to be able to opt-out of the entire Google Adwords experience and only receive generic ads that are not targeted specifically at them.</p>\n\n<p>In a TV environment, it means consumers can opt out of the personalized recommendation, marketing, and targeted advertising, and receive only a standard set of communications. Over time, we also expect this to progress such that developers of targeting algorithms will need to be able to demonstrate that they do not discriminate against protected minorities. Automatic targeting algorithms frequently overlook the disabled, underprivileged ethnic groups, and older people. Algorithms that provide a financial benefit, such as a particular offer, will need to be tested to ensure that it is equally likely to make the same offer to all ethnic groups.</p>\n\n<p>Profiling of children remains illegal under the GDPR, and we continue to advise TV providers to exclude viewing of children’s programming in any profiling decisions. Creating segments of homes with children based on viewing activity is illegal under European law.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"accountability\">Accountability</h2>\n\n<p>As well as providing new rights for consumers, GDPR ramps up the responsibilities of data collecting organization. We\'ve always recommended that companies do not collect more information than they need but it has not previously been illegal. Under GDPR, the bulk collection of TV data with the little purpose of reason goes from being dangerous to grounds for prosecution.</p>\n\n<p>Requirements around anonymisation also change. Whereas it would previously it would have been enough to translate uniquely identifiable fields into tokens, this is no longer sufficient. This process referred to as pseudonymization, changes personally recognizable information such as email address or mailing address into a unique code. As we’ve previously written[link] about, such a process is inherently open to reidentification, and under GDPR the responsibility is on the data collector to minimize the risks of re-identification.</p>\n\n<p>Data collectors also now need to record all details of data processing and transfers to third parties. A log of data processing and shipping is simple to implement, and something that we expect to become part of the information on the consumers that are made available on websites.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"so-how-does-this-affect-my-business-models\">So how does this affect my business models?</h2>\n\n<p>Many businesses are concerned that GDPR is going to kill subscriber analytics, advanced advertising, and online retargeting. Our interpretation is that it’s going to make processing these models more costly for companies, but it\'s also going to make it more transparent and that this is in the long term going to be better for consumers and the industry.</p>\n\n<p>The EU opt-in legislation did not kill online cookies, and we equally expect very few consumer to refuse to opt-in to online targeting. The increased transparency and specifically the rights to rectification and the right to portability will significantly increase the quality of the data that we use for our predictive analytics, and that’s going to make for better outcomes.</p>\n\n<p>Better data means better business, and GDPR is all about better data.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 86, 6);

Unfortunately for TV operators, football is seasonal, and subscribers struggling to pay their bills frequently hold on to the end of the season before cancelling their subscription. Three months later when the new season begins they can sign up for a new package with all of the new subscribers deals available to them.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-can-operators-reduce-this-end-of-season-churn\">How can operators reduce this end of season churn?</h2>\n\n<p>Direct marketing offers the most obvious approach. All operators know their sports subscribers, but by analysing viewer data, operators can further target football fans, and even fans of specific teams. A tailored programme of direct marketing over the summer with news and updates on their favourite teams can go a long way to reduce the chances of churn.</p>\n\n<p>Retention offers. Most operators now have dedicated staff to handle subscribers leaving the service. Putting viewer data into the call centre means that football related churn can be handled differently to other types.

Upcoming information on programming in the new season can be given, and for those most at risk a short term discount could be given over the summer.</p>\n\n<p>Out of season content. With no major tournaments in 2013, operators need to work harder to commission and buy-in exclusive content.

INSERT INTO `aldryn_newsblog_article_translation` VALUES (92, 'en', 'Optimizing Amazon Redshift for Predictive Data Analytics', 'optimizing-amazon-redshift-predictive-data-analytics', '<p>Our data engineers have built a lot of data warehouses that run on Amazon Redshift. Redshift can be a great platform when efficiently used, but like many others, it\'s difficult to get it work well.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ve now at the stage where we\'ve collected enough information on what works and what doesn\'t that it\'s valuable enough to pull together our best tips into this post.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"optimize-your-schema\">Optimize your schema</h2>\n\n<p>Many data engineers start out dumping data into redshift with little thought to the schema and hoping the columnar database engine will magically work out the best way to query the database. We find that this makes it very to run predictive analytics and your data scientists are likely to spend more time waiting for queries to run than creating new models.</p>\n\n<p>If you don\'t want to start a battle between your data scientists and your data engineers, we recommend an approach where we implement an efficient schema based on a standard data warehouse star schema. Although Redshift doesn\'t contain indexes in the same way that traditional databases do, you need to pay considerable attention to the concept of distribution keys and sort keys.</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>\n	<p><strong>Distribution keys</strong> - The distribution keys define how data is distributed amongst the different nodes. You always want to have a uniform distribution of data so your distribution key should typically be set to a key that has millions of different values. This is most commonly a device ID or a user ID. Those tables that don\'t contain a device ID or a user ID should subsequently have a distribution style of ALL so they can efficiently be joined to the main tables</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p><strong>Sort keys</strong> - The sort keys are the closest equivalent to a traditional database index. If you have data ordered by time, then the time field should almost always be the first sort key. If there are other ranges you filter on then, these should also be included in the sort key. Beyond that, joins can be made more efficient by putting the sort key on the primary key of the table you are joining to.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p><strong>Sort key styles</strong> - We always recommend to start off by using COMPOUND sort keys as the INTERLEAVED usually are less efficient.</p>\n	</li>\n	<li>\n	<p><strong>Foreign keys</strong> - Although Amazon Redshift does not enforce foreign key constraints, they are used by the query optimizer, and as such we always include them in our table definitions.</p>\n	</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"manage-your-disk-space\">Manage your disk space</h2>\n\n<p>When you are running predictive analytics on the data warehouse, your Amazon Redshift queries can be very disk intensive, and therefore good data engineers will also ensure that there is always disk space good headroom. Although it\'s easy to add new nodes to the data warehouse, this can become very expensive. The more data Amazon Redshift needs to read from disk, the longer it\'s going to take to run any queries.</p>\n\n<p>Table bloat can be caused by two things. Firstly, if you\'ve been inserting data into the table in a different order to the sort order of the table, or if you\'ve been updating data, then you are going to need to vacuum the

This is very simple, and you just need to run:</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlight\">\n<pre><span class=\"k\">ANALYZE</span> <span class=\"n\">COMPRESSION</span> <span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"k\">table_name</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span>\n</pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>And it will show you which columns can have space saved by changing the encoding on them. You can change the encoding by using the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-redshift-utils/tree/master/src/ColumnEncodingUtility\">Amazon Redshift Column Encoding Utility</a> provided by AWS. Note that this script will not update any views table specific permissions for users so you will need to recreate these separately and also delete the backup tables it creates.</p>\n\n<p>If you\'ve run VACUUM and have good compression on the table, then the only result is that it\'s merely a large table. You then got three choices:</p>\n\n<ol>\n	<li>Add more nodes to the data warehouse. Although simple, this is also the most expensive option. It will resolve the space issues immediately.</li>\n	<li>Look at changing the node type. If you are using DC2 nodes but you are blocked on disk space then you should look at switching on DS2 nodes. They have significantly fewer CPU resources but a lot more space.</li>\n	<li>UNLOAD old data to S3 and setup Redshift Spectrum to provide access to this older data. This will slow down access to older data, but it also means you only pay for the storage in S3 which is a lot cheaper than Amazon Redshift.

As we were developing the Inscape census smart TV data, I struggled with these definitions.</p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, you can think of census TV data (e.g., device level data from set-top boxes or Smart TVs) as an aggregation of the first party data sets for all the networks, local stations and advertisers that are in the dataset. That’s kinda exciting (and valuable). Such data sets are aggregated and provided by a vendor. And they can be used as third-party data. For example, a census data vendor can supply a list of TVs that have displayed college sports or ESPN or Big Ten Network, or what have you. In this case, it really is third-party data.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Match Fabric\" src=\"https://static.deductive.com/img/match-fabric.jpg\"></p>\n\n<p>But that isn’t the primary use of such data. There are a great many uses, but the one that is most interesting at least presently is to use the data for what I decided might be called, “Match Fabric.”</p>\n\n<p>Why? Because the fascinating value of census TV viewing data is unlocked when we enable advertisers, agencies, networks, and stations to match specific audiences to the viewing data. This tends to occur in something of a cycle.</p>\n\n<p>On the buy side, advertisers, long frustrated with crude demographic targeting for TV advertising, can now match first, second or third party data to viewing data. An example of a first party data match might be generating a list of people that bought a Ford truck five years ago. Such people might provide a useful target set for a new pickup truck ad. Ford, or it’s agency (or data vendor!) can match their truck owners list to the TV viewing dataset to produce a list of networks, dayparts or shows that have high concentrations of the target list.</p>\n\n<p>With initiatives like OpenAP, Ford can then ask TV ad sellers to sell them a media buy focused on shows with high concentrations of such viewers. Then the campaign runs. With the list matched to TV display devices, the ad seller or an intermediary (or Ford’s data vendor!) can then measure the actual reach and frequency of the campaign against the target list to measure effective target GRP.</p>\n\n<p>But we’re not entirely done. With another match – this time Ford truck buyers – we can produce a deterministic measurement of TV ad effectiveness. This not only reveals which ad spots not only reached the most people in the target group but also provides the highest number of truck purchases. We can see the impact of frequency on conversion as well as recency and combinations of recency and frequency (e.g., the optimal result for truck purchases might come from a frequency of 3 within 11 days).</p>\n\n<p>So, census TV viewing data turns out to be extremely valuable centrally because it can be used to match audience targets to audience delivery, to target media-buying more efficiently and make it more efficient. I use the term ‘Match Fabric’ because we are using the census smart TV data connect audiences to behavior and the phrase illuminates the virtue and value of the data.</p>\n\n<p>Over time, we expect that efficiency will quickly evolve from effective CPM, or the cost to reach my target audience, to conversions per dollar of media spend. Once the seller of mobile games know how many downloads they\'re getting per dollar, that quickly becomes much more important than audience measurement – at least for those advertisers that can rapidly capture and apply consumer behavioral data.</p>\n\n<p>However, such systems are only as good as the quality of the data that is employed, and the quality of the systems that glue it all together. After serving my term at Inscape, I joined Deductive because I think there’s great value in high-quality sourcing, matching, transforming, modeling and implementing census data as well as the audience and behavioral data that we match to it. We don’t make data, but we do help generators, owners and licensees build solutions based on Match Fabric.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', 'Census TV data from set-top-boxes and Smart TV data provides \'match fabric\' to join different data sets such as first, second, and third party', 'http://itvt.com/story/11268/industry-column-census-tv-data-match-fabric', 0, 93, 6);

When you\'re buying and selling segments, you\'re frequently left to wait until the end of the advertising campaign to measure the performance. If you\'ve been disappointed it\'s then too late to know whether the segments were right, correct, or whether you just had the wrong creative or call to action in the campaign.</p>\n\n<p>We\'ve started systematically looking at segment quality using some different mechanisms: looking for statistical correlations between datasets; comparing them against a random sample of the data, and even running primary research against new segments to establish what degree of truth the datasets might have.</p>\n\n<p>By directly validating the truth behind a segment we start to establish a degree of currency in the segment business. The example below shows the result of a test we\'ve run on an online segment that is readily purchasable online, and although buying against it is clearly more efficient than buying generic traffic, there is a long way to go in improving the quality.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"TV Data Collection\" src=\"https://static.deductive.com/img/quality-score.png\"></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"validating-segments-by-correlation\">Validating segments by correlation</h2>\n\n<p>Because many segments overlap, we don\'t need to run primary research on all of them to be able to model a scorecard for a broad set.</p>\n\n<p>Take for example, a segment of people owning homes worth over $1m. We would expect this segment to have a high overlap with people earning more than $200k a year or those with a high credit rating. If we saw correlations with a low credit rating score or no association with other high-net-worth segments we would start to lower the score we give it.</p>\n\n<p>This approach allows us to score most segments effectively, but we still struggle in areas like Pet Owners or Auto Intenders.</p>\n\n<p>In these cases, we have to rely on primary research. Countless surveys have told us that women are more likely to own cats than men, but merely seeing a correlation between the Cat Owner segment and the Female segment is not clear enough as over 50% of the population is female, and far fewer than 50% own cats.</p>\n\n<p>If we can correlate between purchasers of cat food and cat owners, this could be a root. However, we have to be careful about how the segments are themselves derived. If the Cat Owner segment derives from purchasing patterns we are testing the hypothesis against the predicate.</p>\n\n<p>To get the best view of segment quality, we need more than just correlations. A combination of primary research, correlations, and random sampling signals the future, and the results we see to date are promising.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 94, 26);

The following year, two researchers at the University of Texas, Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0610105.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">published a paper</a> about the Netflix Prize dataset. They had taken a look at this data and developed a methodology to break the anonymization of this dataset.</p>\n\n<p>They could look at the 10 million anonymized records and track them back to individuals with astonishing accuracy. Their work lead to a class action lawsuit against Netflix for breach of privacy, including a high profile case of an \"in the closet\" lesbian who claimed to have been \"outed\" by the Netflix dataset.</p>\n\n<p>Ten years later, the UK government has been conducting trials of anonymous movement of passengers through the London subway by measuring WiFi. Throughout Europe, government agencies are required by law to release any information so requested by citizen\'s but the government has <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/07/how-anonymous-wifi-data-can-still-be-a-privacy-risk/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">refused to release</a> this information on the basis that it\'s anonymization is not secure, and individuals can still be reidentified through the data.</p>\n\n<p>If both Netflix and the UK government are having difficulty in anonymizing their datasets, there must be something going on.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"so-what-is-the-problem-with-so-called-anonymous-data\">So what is the problem with so-called anonymous data?</h2>\n\n<p>The principal of data anonymization is to take anything personally identifiable, for example, your phone number or your email address, and replace it with an anonymous token.</p>\n\n<p>You might initially think this makes the data secure, but by combining the dataset with other datasets, it\'s relatively straightforward to reidentify. If I have licensed a dataset that lists the websites that anonymous cookies have visited. I might have bought this dataset to understand better which sites make a better target for my online campaign or to retarget visitors from another service when they visit mine.</p>\n\n<p>Now when I receive this data, it doesn\'t contain any personally identifiable information (PII), but if I have a login on my website, then I can match a visitor to my site directly to the feed. All I need to do is match the data and time of the actions of an anonymous user on the data feed with the date and time of activities on my website, and I\'ve got a match. I\'ve now reidentified the consumer and have access to all of the other sites they\'ve visited from the cookie feed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"why-is-this-a-big-issue\">Why is this a big issue?</h2>\n\n<p>The biggest problem with reidentification is that any PII is regulated differently to other data. The serial number on the engine of my car can be stored in multiple different databases and freely exchanged between third parties by my auto provider. My name and address are tightly regulated, my personal property, and cannot be shared between third parties without my explicit consent.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, when people permit sharing of their personal information, it comes with restrictions of purpose. For example, you might provide their financial information to a bank as part of a mortgage application, but you are not permitting the bank to sell the same information to third parties to target you with better credit card deals.</p>\n\n<p>If we are sharing data between parties and we cannot prohibit reidentification then we cannot guarantee the security of our consumer\'s data or that the uses of the data are going to comply with the terms and conditions we agreed with our consumers when we collected their data.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"so-what-can-we-do-about-it\">So what can we do about it?</h2>\n\n<p>The safest way to prevent reidentification is to follow the example of the UK government and not share any information with third parties. This does however restrict not only the consumer experience but also many legitimate business opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>More commonly, businesses will share data but take contractual and technical precautions to prevent reidentification. The technical approaches to avoid reidentification are regular anonymisation or developing a service on top of the raw data.</p>\n\n<p>The first of these is to change the anonymous tokens for each consumer on a routine basis. This limits the ability of third parties to track individuals over time, which significantly diminishes the ability to reidentify consumers. You might be able to follow that someone has visited a specific site once, but you cannot then track what they are doing the next day.</p>\n\n<p>However, as well as restricting the risks of reidentification, this also reduces the usefulness of the data from a business model perspective. If you can only track what a consumer is doing from day to day, it\'s much less valuable than seeing the full picture of their activities over a year.</p>\n\n<p>The only way of further reducing the chances of reidentification is to provide a service rather than a data feed. I\'ve <a href=\"/data-sushi/\">written previously</a> about the perils of asking for the raw data, and when it comes to data security, offering an API to query information on aggregated subsets of consumers or even individual consumers in real time, is much more secure than providing a more detailed data feed to your subscribers.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-bottom-line\">The bottom line</h2>\n\n<p>At Deductive, our view is that all information relating to subscribers is potentially reidentifiable. All data is therefore possible PII and needs to the same level of security as PII.</p>\n\n<p>The Netflix class action was finally settled in 2011 for $9m. That might be a drop in the ocean for Netflix financially, but reputationally no one can afford to play fast and loose with their consumers\' data.</p>\n\n<p>Contractually, you need to prevent third parties from reidentification and furthermore only share data with those you can trust to act accordingly. If your business relies upon sharing more broadly, we recommend developing an API or a data-driven service rather than providing a raw data feed.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 96, 6);

INSERT INTO `aldryn_newsblog_article_translation` VALUES (98, 'en', 'Sample sizes, universes, margins of error - going small with big data', 'five-million-homes', '<p>If you’re used to analyzing advertising campaigns based on Nielsen data, you’re used to having around 25,000 homes at your disposal. If you step up to connected device data, you\'re more likely to have 5 million or more homes in front of you. That’s a two-hundred-fold increase in the amount of data you’ve got your hands on. You can certainly measure everything at a much more granular level and analysis that was previously only possible on national networks can run on pay channels or local networks. Where we might previously have been able to optimize on dayparts, we can now optimize by the hour. 15 minute departs can now be broken down to 5-second granularity.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-low-can-we-go\">How low can we go?</h2>\n\n<p>But what\'s the cut-off point? Customers are often asking us how small we can go in terms of measuring campaigns that, for example, may only incorporate a few small DMAs, or a small addressable campaign in the hundreds of thousands of impressions. To do this, we use sampling error to help us figure out whether, even with 5 million devices, we can accurately measure an audience. </p>\n\n<p>When we’re doing any analysis based on a sample of a population - such as 5 million TVs in a country of 119 million TV homes - we calculate the sampling error to establish how meaningful our results are.</p>\n\n<p>Using a 95% confidence interval, a sample of 5 million TVs across the country will be accurate at the level of 100 TVs to within 19 TVs and 1000 TVs to within 61 TVs.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, any results that rely on 100 TVs are 95% likely to be accurate to within 19% of the reported values, and any results that depend on 1000 TVs are 95% likely to be accurate to with 6.1% of the reported values. We need to get up to 50,000 TVs to end up being 95% confident that we are within 1% of the actual result.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, this means that to get minute by minute ratings, you need over a hundred devices watching each minute. If we are going to break this down by DMA, we need 100 per DMA.</p>\n\n<p>For ratings, this means that we can run minute-by-minute ratings for any show with an average rating of 0.01%. For shows with a 1% rating, we can run minute by minute ratings for each of the top 50 DMAs.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"where-did-the-audience-come-from\">Where did the audience come from?</h2>\n\n<p>We can also look better at how the audience moves between networks. If we have around 100 TVs coming from each different station, we can do great analysis on audience flow. In practice, we need several thousand devices watching a show for this to be practical.</p>\n\n<p>With our five million homes, we can run audience flow analysis on any programming that has a rating of more than 0.1%. That’s a lot of programming where we can measure exactly why these shows are gaining the audience and why others are losing it. It is game-changing for schedulers. For larger shows, we can even drill down to exactly when people are switching and why.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-effective-is-my-advertising\">How effective is my advertising?</h2>\n\n<p>Running closed look effectiveness on advertising requires massive dataset. A national campaign that hits 30% of the population and has a conversion rate of 30% gives us an analysis sample of 30% of the 30%, or 9%.</p>\n\n<p>With our 5 million homes this gives us 45,000 devices. We can split this down into several hundred different segments and still have a small sampling error in each of these segments. We can compare networks and dayparts across a whole load of DMAs. We can also do frequency optimization, measuring differences in conversion rate for the different number of devices.</p>\n\n<p>We can even undertake frequency optimization for smaller campaigns by aggregating data across multiple campaigns to get the audience up to the level of statistical significance. With smaller budgets, it’s even more important to know how to spend, and when we’ve looked at the data, we’ve often found that smaller advertisers are over-buying on frequency at the expense of reach.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"multi-touch-attribution-on-smaller-campaigns\">Multi-touch attribution on smaller campaigns</h2>\n\n<p>Beyond frequency optimization, we can split the audience down to analyze scenarios where we didn’t run on some networks, day-parts or programming. For example, consider a smaller campaign running on three networks with a total reach of 3% and 3% conversion. We get only end up with 4500 TVs in our analysis, but we can still split them down to look at a subset that only saw on network A, those that saw on B and those that saw on B or C but not A.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to know the uplift you got from a particular network you need to be able to break out how the campaign would have looked like without this network, and with five million homes this becomes an everyday analysis you can include on every campaign</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-comes-next\">What comes next?</h2>\n\n<p>People are constantly upgrading both their TV sets and cable boxes, and more and more of these newer devices are connected. By increasing the number of devices available for analysis, we increase the granularity that goes with this. However, even if we increase from 5 million homes to the entire country, that’s only a twenty-fold increase in granularity, not another hundredfold improvement.</p>\n\n<p>The big increases in numbers are now behind us, and as an industry, we should focus less on going from 5 million to 25 million devices, and more on ensuring that the millions of devices reflect the make-up of the country. The sampling error is only a valid calculation if you are sure your population is not skewed. The value of Nielsen’s panel is not its size but the fact that it is representative. We need to get the same focus in device data: once you’ve reached 5 million homes the value is in how well the data represents the country, not simply in how many homes it represents.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 98, 1);

We\'ve been using an Elastic stack for quite a while and have recently migrated to the excellent hosted solution from logz.io.</p>\n\n<p>With logz.io we install the filebeat client on each of our servers and all of the logs from that instance go straight to logz.io where we monitor and alert on them in a single place.</p>\n\n<p>So far, so good. However, one of our latest client\'s systems runs on Elastic Beanstalk which has given us an interesting problem. Elastic Beanstalk is a great scalable environment from Amazon Web Services, and one of its best features is a single configuration for all environments - development, live, staging, etc. - with the differences between the environment managed solely through environment variables.</p>\n\n<p>However, the example code provided to configure logging using Filebeat from Elastic Beanstalk does not work with environment variables. It took us a long time to work out exactly what the problem was and we wanted to share the solution here.</p>\n\n<p>To understand why, we first need to take a look at how the-the configuration files for Elastic Beanstalk, the .ebextensions files work.</p>\n\n<p>From the documentation on AWS, we can see that we have six different commands:</p>\n\n<ul>\n	<li>The packages section installs different packages as required</li>\n	<li>The groups and users sections creates Linux groups and users</li>\n	<li>The sources section will download files from a public archive</li>\n	<li>The files section specifies files to write onto the system</li>\n	<li>The commands section specifies commands that should run after the files section</li>\n	<li>The services section determines services will run when the instance starts</li>\n	<li>The container_commands section specifies commands that should run once the environment is set up and ready to use</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The problem with all of the examples we\'ve seen online is that they initiate filebeat in the commands section which is before the environment variables are set. As the environment variables are set up as part of the container, we need to switch the filebeat configuration to the container_commands sections and everything works!</p>\n\n<p>You can see our setup

Sitting at the counter eating sushi and drinking sake with my friends felt like the most glamorous thing in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Now, when I\'m talking to clients and hear them asking about access to the \"raw\" data I wonder if they have the same infatuation I had with raw fish. It took me a good ten years to re-acclimatise myself to the pleasures of cooked fish and I think I same thing happening in the world of TV data.</p>\n\n<p>When people talk about raw data, it usually comes from a desire to not be constrained by what they want to do with the data. With raw data, it\'s assumed that anything is possible, and it can be processed exactly as required. That is certainly true, but if you\'re asking for the \"raw\" data you also need to be very clear on what you are really asking for.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"its-really-easy-to-make-sushi-right\">It\'s really easy to make sushi, right?</h2>\n\n<p>In video, raw data is frequently little more than click-stream information from the remote control (set-top box) data, or a list of frames that match an ingested stream (Smart TV data).</p>\n\n<p>This data is messy and complex, and like a visitor to a restaurant who wants more than a raw fish dumped on his or her plate, most agencies or networks probably don’t want to be ingesting that kind of raw data.</p>\n\n<p>Most people, when they request “raw” data mean that they want a granular, sanitised dataset that they can drill down to the level of an individual device. They want any inconsistencies in the data smoothed out, they want the population to have been made representative of the market they are measuring, and they want data they can trust, and that won’t make them look silly in front of clients.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, they want the opposite of raw data. They want finely prepared fish. There are three key steps to make your data sushi appetising and palatable, as follows:</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-1-smoothing-out-the-inconsistencies\">Step 1: Smoothing out the inconsistencies</h2>\n\n<p>Raw data is full of common inconsistencies. Set-top-boxes that occasionally report viewing from the 1st January 1970. Fast-forward or rewind session data is often missing. In Smart TV data, if the same content is on two networks at once, the ACR algorithm can sometimes flip-flop between the two. OTT data can have inconsistences between iOS and Android. This is just a small sample of common issues and and any dataset needs to go through a rigorous cleansing process to remove these erroneous instances.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-2-make-it-representative\">Step 2: Make it representative</h2>\n\n<p>Set-top-box data typically is only sourced from an MVPD’s footprint. This needs to be modeled for by applying it to the rest of the country, and any skews in that footprint need to be removed. With more and more people using antennas to get terrestrial broadcast, STB data is already going to be missing large chunks of the population - increasingly in its footprint, as well as outside it.</p>\n\n<p>Smart TV is more representative as it covers cable, satellite and broadcast, but it’s only going to cover homes where people have bought a new TV in the last few years and where they’ve connected to the internet through wi-fi. That’s still going to skew the data towards more prosperous and younger people.</p>\n\n<p>Even OTT data-which, by its nature, is representative of every device using that service, needs to be ‘de-skewed’ by eliminating test data and bot views.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"step-3-no-food-poisoning-please\">Step 3: Make sure you avoid food poisoning</h2>\n\n<p>Finally, you need to be sure that the data is reliable. Nielsen is often rapped for being late in delivering its data. Late is not the worst data can be: data providers frequently have outages and you need resilience in your data strategy to cope with this.</p>\n\n<p>No one wants food poisoning. <a href=\"https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/more-tv-news/nielsen-delays-explained-or-where-are-the-weekend-and-monday-ratings/\">When a power outage in Florida delayed the release of Nielsen ratings by several days back in 2017,</a> people complained, but it was eventually published. If you\'re taking data to your client claiming that nobody watched their competitor’s commercial, you had better be sure there wasn’t an outage at your data provider during that period. It’s better that you wait for your sushi and get it in perfect condition than getting it on time but far from fresh.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"leave-raw-data-to-the-sushi-masters\">Leave raw data to the sushi masters</h2>\n\n<p>That sashimi on your plate may look delightfully simple and elegant, but a lot has gone into getting it there. It takes five years of hard work to train to be a sushi chef, and creating data sushi is no less complicated.</p>\n\n<p>Unless you have an army of fully-trained sushi chefs on staff, I\'d recommend you ask for the processed data from your data providers, and to leave the raw data to the data masters.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 102, 1);

The mix of viewing between live, PVR, VoD and OTT, and how that evolves, is illuminating. It provides them with insight around:</p>\n\n<p>At Deductive, we work with operators all over the world, in different market positions and with very different service propositions. This gives us a unique vantage point to better understand how viewing might evolve from a live to a multi-modal model, and how those dynamics might differ around the world. It goes without saying that there are big differences in different markets. As the below chart shows, across four of our customers, the mix is very different. The one commonality is that live viewing still dominates, but the extent to which it does, and the nuances behind why, vary.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Alt Text\" src=\"https://static.deductive.com/img/multimodal-2.png\"></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"so-what-else-have-we-learned\">So what else have we learned?</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"there-is-a-definite-pvr-ceiling\">There is a definite PVR ceiling</h3>\n\n<p>Data we have seen across our customers supports a theory that there is a ceiling for PVR usage of around 20% of total viewing across most operators. This is a very different outcome from some of the more outlandish predictions made about DVRs when they began to gain traction fifteen years ago. A future of subscribers recording everything – and skipping all the ads – has not come to pass.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"why-do-we-think-this-is-the-case\">Why do we think this is the case?</h3>\n\n<p>The PVR is a piece of durable technology that simply works. Within some of our customers, there is a much greater preference for viewing on PVR than there is to use VoD, despite considerable effort marketing the latter, and despite the fact it is in some ways more convenient than VoD But it hasn’t broken beyond the 20% barrier. We think this is down to a combination of new viewing methods and the on-going durability of live TV. TV is a passive medium, and in many cases, viewers simply don’t want to have to chose what to watch.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"vod-is-title-driven-ott-is-context-driven\">VoD is Title Driven, OTT is Context-Driven</h3>\n\n<p>As a rule of thumb, VoD tends to be title-driven. Even though overall VoD viewing may not take up much of the mix, some big titles – series, aimed at younger viewers, take a much bigger share, as the below data from Comcast shows We see a different story with OTT. Take the data below from one of our customers, Astro. It shows that viewing of its AOTG OTT service is split widely between genres. Genres like news and live events feature heavily and there is much less of a bias towards movies and big shows. Big series and movies take up only around a third of consumption.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Alt Text\" src=\"https://static.deductive.com/img/multimodal-3.png\"></p>\n\n<p>The evidence to date indicates that viewers are using VoD to find shows that they know they want to watch, but that OTT is being used to replace “core” viewing – albeit in low numbers, for now. And there’s lots of live viewing on OTT, too – the consumer appeal of being able to never miss a key moment – sports, breaking news, reality show, is clear. For this reason, we think the way questions of the future of live TV is posed – “will new forms of viewing destroy live TV”, and so on, are the wrong.</p>\n\n<p>The more interesting question is not whether live TV will be replaced, but rather where, how and from whom viewers will get their live fix.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ott-in-emerging-markets-will-be-very-different\">OTT in emerging markets will be very different</h3>\n\n<p>There’s an established narrative about how multiscreen services that are tethered to Pay TV services (think Sky Go, Comcast X1, and so on) will benefit operators. They tend to be pitched at higher APRU customers, particularly sports viewers, as loyalty plays. This isn’t really playing out in emerging markets. We see it very clearly in the first figure in this piece for Customer 2, where OTT viewing is much higher than VoD viewing.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve seen operators like Sky, again, try and target the “cord cutting” market with services like Now TV, with the assumption that top-tier customers will continue to use premium set-top box-features like Sky Q.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Alt Text\" src=\"https://static.deductive.com/img/multimodal-4.png\"></p>\n\n<p>But we’re starting to see premium customers in emerging markets embracing OTT, often instead of using set-top box-based services. Why? It’s a combination of lower broadband penetration, the cost of providing set-top boxes in lower markets, and the fact that many of the markets the provider works in really are “mobile first” markets in a way that Western markets are not. The debate about when operators move towards a set-top box-less future continues to rage, but we may see this happen in emerging markets first.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"limited-netflix-impactyet\">Limited Netflix Impact…Yet</h3>\n\n<p>For better or worse, lots of what the TV industry does is driven by what OTT providers, principally Netflix, have done. Across our customer base, we’ve seen, perhaps surprisingly, limited evidence of a correlation between the popularity of OTT services in their markets, and a shift in consumption.The global launch of Netflix has not dramatically shifted the consumption mix for most of our customers.</p>\n\n<p>It’s early days, of course. But it’s worth pointing out that there is divergence in what different customers want even in advanced OTT markets. Not all segments are interested in either the content Netflix et al offers – or even OTT in general. So it is perfectly feasible that a market where Netflix is particularly popular may not impact viewing on a competitor platform, if the two are targeting different audience segments with different offers.</p>\n\n<p>There’s also the issue that in many of our markets, the OTT market is being driven by our customers’ markets, and not stand-alone OTT providers. There is a misconception that operators are simply jumping into OTT because of Netflix that does not always apply, particularly in developing markets.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"what-this-all-means\">What this all means</h2>\n\n<p>Understanding how subscribers are moving between viewing methods, and how that split evolves over time, is one thing – understanding how to profit from it is another. Operators need to have a holistic view of how their subscribers consume content across different viewing methods, how to maximise consumption and engagement across them, and understand how competitive pressures will impact the viewing mix.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 107, 6);

It looks like SE Asia will be the world’s highest growth region for pay TV in general and OTT in particular over the next five years. Naturally operators with international ambitions of whatever category, whether legacy or pure play OTT, are keen to exploit this growth but to do so they must take account of the region’s distinctive market dynamics and consumer behaviors.</p>\n\n<p>The first obvious point to note is the great disparity between the various countries, so that any operator targeting the region as a whole must avoid a one size fits all approach and give each country separate consideration. There is also a broad difference between the richer nations such as Japan, Singapore and South Korea, which have advanced broadband infrastructures along with high smartphone penetration, and developing nations like Indonesia and the Philippines that do not. In the developing nations, lack of widespread broadband infrastructure and unaffordability of smartphones combined with limited availability of 3G or 4G mobile networks has held back OTT so far. But now the brakes are really coming off as infrastructure improves and with the arrival of Netflix as well as various local pure play OTT operators such as Hooq.</p>\n\n<p>But despite the significant differences between countries there are some common themes that operators need to take account of in formulating a more regional strategy. The most evident one is the continuing prevalence of censorship and the impact this has on consumer behavior. Censorship restricts certain content containing scenes deemed explicit or violent from pay TV operators, but in some cases this is available on OTT services, and to certain sectors such as ex-patriates of other countries. Desire to watch such censored content is one factor that has driven consumers towards pirated services and also in some cases OTT as that can fall outside the jurisdiction of regulators.</p>\n\n<p>Netflix has run up against this in Indonesia and with similar confusion reigning in other leading Asian markets, prospective operators need to keep abreast of developments and meanwhile there may be opportunities for OTT providers to score by giving subscribers content they can’t get elsewhere.</p>\n\n<p>There are some other aspects regarding OTT that may not be unique to the region but are amplified there. One is the fact that many of the markets, especially developing ones, tend to be split into two tiers, one centered around more affluent consumers in areas with good broadband connectivity, where OTT is posing a more direct challenge to premium pay TV packages.</p>\n\n<p>The other sector, the one at a nascent stage in many countries, is focused on mobile broadband as the medium. This serves viewers who until now have received TV either Free-To-Air or over those very low ARPU pay TV services costing just a few dollars a month that are widespread in India for example and to an extent China as well.</p>\n\n<p>Alongside these trends seems to be a voracious appetite for OTT across the region, helping to make up for lost time in terms of traction and demand. This factor is clearly helping drive the current surge in connected video consumption across those huge markets. A compounding factor is that live video programming holds strong appeal in those countries too. These two findings together strongly suggest premium live OTT services would prove almost universally popular in the region.</p>\n\n<p>Another finding from various surveys is the desire for personalization, which points towards intelligent use of data analytics to identify individual preferences and sift populations into demographic segments for broader targeting of recommendations as well as ads. There is also a stronger desire for local content than in some regions, which is why the more astute broadcasters have already invested both in localization of existing content and original production when that is economically viable. BBC Worldwide for example has produced Asian versions of shows including Strictly Come Dancing. Astro has completely different program lineups for Chinese, Indian and Malaysian audiences, as well as for various ex-patriate groups</p>\n\n<p>The clear message is that the prizes for getting SE Asia right are considerable but only for operators that have taken the trouble to address the region’s singularities and also differences between countries. OTT must be at the heart of the strategy even for traditional pay TV operators.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 108, 8);

Lots of stats are being bandied around: 2016 Rio Summer Olympics viewership was down by 10% when compared to the London 2012 Games. For the English Premier League, early 2017 season ratings for matches on Sky Sports were down by 20%, and there are more deep-seated fears in the US, where NFL coverage has suffered a 10% decline in viewers this season.</p>\n\n<p>But here at Deductive, we’re still bullish about sports. Let’s not forget – it’s still true that almost every successful MVPD has built its audience to a greater or lesser extent thanks to live sports, and millions of us still tune in to watch peak sporting events.</p>\n\n<p>But there are issues. We’ve had it put to us that amongst younger generations, there is perhaps a tendency to get updates on the ‘important details’ by watching the goals in the highlight clips, seeing one player’s heinous tackle in GIF form and following the Twitter storm surrounding the referee’s appalling offside call, rather than watching the whole 80 or 90-minute event. Piracy is also certainly an issue, with the illegal re-streaming of live sports beginning to affect viewing figures.</p>\n\n<p>But this in itself is a complex situation, and may be financially motivated. In other vertical markets, we’ve seen how other subscribers won’t pay for a top tier offering, but will pay for a “Pay-Lite” proposition. In sports, the biggest matches and events are key to the proposition. This doesn’t translate very readily to a pay-lite scenario – although a few MVPDs are giving it a good go.</p>\n\n<p>For MVPDs and sports networks, what’s clear is that a ‘one-size fits all’ content strategy will not last as a ‘pan-generational’ plan – and harnessing audience data is vital to achieving this.</p>\n\n<p>In such a competitive and aggressive market, it is even more important that MVPDs utilise data to retain existing viewers and increase revenues. To begin with, automation of audience segmentation can help facilitate better targeting of customers and help MVPDs to cross-market effectively, allowing service providers to identify other types of content which can be marketed to ‘typical’ sports fans. For example, by discovering that fans of a certain team or sport over-index for a particular channel or content genre helps a broadcaster identify cross-marketing opportunities more effectively. Additionally, data can identify that when a viewer has an affinity with one sport, it’s much more likely that they will enjoy another sport, leading to even further exciting cross-marketing opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>Utilising real-time data is also extremely valuable when trying to re-engage viewers. Real-time information can be used to generate more push-notifications and alerts about the content they want to watch, such as reminders about upcoming matches or alerts for imminent kick off times. Increasing the value of advertising breaks during sports can also be improved through harnessing data about the way consumers view ads.</p>\n\n<p>For traditional media companies reliant on high value – and increasingly high cost – sports rights, this decline should ring alarm bells. However, commentators have been ringing this bell for years and still sports have been incredibly affective in building pay-TV audiences. However, as rights costs rise, we believe it’s even more important that MVPDs harness the data they have at their disposal around sports viewership to maximize ROI by increasing sports viewing, stickiness and the effectiveness of its cross marketing activities.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 112, 6);

In one case we looked at people who had actually bought smart watches and compared them with another group identified as potential buyers, along with the audience as a whole.

In other words they are exhibiting self-censorship.</p>\n\n<p>This is largely why piracy continues to boom in SEA. It is not so much because the content is free or even cheaper from pirates, but more that it is uncensored, which means consumers are often willing to pay more for it. This flies in the face of censorship and we see publicly funded initiatives that do not produce the desired results in these countries.

Adding a censorship classification, e.g. ‘Halal versus Non Halal’, to content would enable Pay TV operators to relax their censorship regulations in the multicultural world we live in today. Most consumers would feel happy to make their own self-censorship decisions and piracy would finally have a strong competitor in this region. Until censorship regulations are relaxed or at least modernized, piracy will continue to flourish and Pay TV operators will remain constrained and threatened.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile the launch of pure play OTT TV services such as iFlix, Hooq and most recently the arrival of Netflix across almost the whole of SE Asia in one go, can be viewed as a threat to pay TV operators. But Netflix’ arrival in particular could also accelerate the process of ending these outdated and counter-productive censorship rules.</p>\n\n<p>OTT itself then can be an ally in the campaign to modernize censorship, even if in the short term there may be some restrictions imposed against mostly US based OTT providers. Already in Indonesia for example, soon after its launch in January 2016, Netflix was blocked by the country’s largest broadband service provided Telekom Indonesia.</p>\n\n<p>Yet for the time being it looks like censorship will continue to be a reality with which most SEA pay TV operators will have to live, just as much as piracy is. Given this situation operators can find clues over how to navigate their way through these various obstacles to success by analyzing more clearly what their subscribers really want and what their habits are. There is a strong culture of sharing and consumers being prepared to find content they want, often purchasing DVDs or Blu-Ray disks available retail at the same price as on TV and then passing them along to friends and family. OperatoOTT_Asia_Pacific_Genius_Digital_2rs should also note that one size doesn’t fit all and OTT providers offering no censorship to everyone is perhaps just as problematic as Pay TV operators having to censor everything.</p>\n\n<p>Operators then need to find ways of targeting their subscribers more effectively and convenience to beat the pirates and retailers. This is where Big Data analytics informed by accurate viewer data coupled with the knowledge about their subscribers that operators can really make a difference.</p>\n\n<p>If operators can segment their subscribers effectively and work out which ones can legitimately receive uncensored content for example, it will help operators increase retention and viewership through personalization, and be in a better position to upsell content. Operators can identify segments that can opt-in to watch uncensored content and navigate the whole regulatory environment much more efficiently. This is an important aspect of Big Data analytics that is fairly specific to SE Asia and likely to remain so for some time to come. Meanwhile we all of course wait for the time when censorship rules are relaxed as we believe will happen eventually, at least in most of the region’s countries.

Sitcoms, and procedurals (think NCIS, Law and Order, and so on) are genres that always took a larger share of their revenues from these mid-tier channels than other types, and are therefore attracting fewer commissioning dollars than they once did.</p>\n\n<p>The report argues that sitcoms are being replaced by reality shows, which deliver a similar blend of light entertainment, laughs and drama while being more predictable in both production cost and projected audience. Then procedurals, which are self-contained stories that can be bundled in a series but with each episode standing alone, work less well for on-demand viewing because they do not build plot and suspense over time. They do not lend themselves to the increasingly popular binge viewing which the leading OTT sVOD players have capitalized on so effectively.</p>\n\n<p>Traditionally, mid-tier content including sitcoms and procedurals has been defined as having broad audience appeal but at a lower level than blockbuster movies and premium sports as well as the top TV shows. But from the supply side perspective of MVPDs and networks, it also includes secondary rights for content that might originally have been top tier. This itself has traditionally constituted a lucrative market when aggregated across multiple assets.</p>\n\n<p>Secondary rights and the associated financing models are being squeezed by OTT. The practice of deficit financing has been hit, the traditional model for TV financing where a content buyer such as a broadcaster shared production costs with the program producer like a studio, with the return on investment coming in second-run windows, such as syndication. But this second window is being taken over by OTT, with the roles of content creator and distributor merging, as in the case of Netflix or Amazon Prime which hold onto global rights for exclusive distribution through secondary windows.</p>\n\n<p>We should note that OTT’s impact on mid-tier content is not all negative and that some genres are flourishing, the obvious example being documentaries. These have the advantage of having a long shelf life, and are sometimes less-time sensitive.</p>\n\n<p>Implications for MVPDs vary. Firstly they need to be aware of these trends and note SNL Kagan’s finding that in the US market networks characterized as mid-tier have witnessed steadily falling ratings over more than a decade, down from 79% of combined cable network ratings in 2005 to 64% in 2015.</p>\n\n<p>Above all, though, they must be able to drill down accurately into their own mid-tier audiences, analyse them more carefully, and stop seeing them as a cheap and easy way to build audience share or to fill schedules. The middle may be being squeezed but there will be exceptions across all genres and it is in this sector where there is perhaps greatest scope for differentiation and innovation for operators in terms of acquisition, packaging and recommendation.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 118, 6);

Ericsson’s latest Mobility Report highlights the growing pervasiveness of video across the whole online content world, including news, advertising and social media, and not just traditional broadcast TV. This means that more long form content is being consumed on smartphones and tablets and implies this trend is likely to continue through to 2020.</p><p>The other very significant trend for pay TV operators highlighted by Ericsson, is the ascendancy of the app for mobile video consumption and the decline of the browser. Already, the top five apps account for two thirds of all app traffic according to Ericsson, with Facebook in the lead generating around 20% of all app data in most leading markets. YouTube and Netflix also feature prominently in most markets, especially the US where they account for 15% and 12% of all app traffic respectively.</p><p>The main implication for operators, broadcasters and content owners is that consumers, including their own customers, will spend more time consuming video within the confines of an app, most often Facebook or one of the OTT service providers, rather than coming in over the open Internet via a browser. They must therefore make sure they have a presence within those app portals where relevant, say a YouTube channel or Facebook page, as well as providing an app of their own. Smart content owners will go where the audience is.</p><p>There is another interesting nuance that has slipped almost beneath the radar despite appearing in a survey from analyst group Gartner, which is that the once unstoppable tablet market has lost some momentum. This is reflected in video consumption going more to the latest large screen smartphones, or “phablets”, and also even to a new generation of so called “skinny laptops”. What we are seeing here is a split in viewing, with longer form material consumed more on larger screens, while the smartphone is the device people will use for snacking because it is just quicker and more convenient. This is leading to the smartphone becoming a pivotal device in the TV experience, taking over from the remote and acting as the universal content portal, but directing a lot of longer form viewing back to the main screen.</p><p>We should not get too bogged down in device definitions, but this is a continued reminder of the ever-changing nature of our industry – and, perhaps, a little cold water on the idea that the tablet will end up replacing the TV on a large scale.</p><p>There are two big implications for all of this: one obvious, one more subtle. The distinction between online and traditional TV viewing is blurring, as we have known for some time. As a result it is becoming essential to have a unified system for measuring viewing. There is likely to be limited future in having separate dedicated panels for TV and online.</p><p>A second, less talked about, implication, is that operators can increasingly have greater level of knowledge about how their services are used than anyone else. This wasn’t always the case, especially in the days where linear TV was the only game in town. It will be more and more difficult for a single third party to measure viewing across multiple screens, devices, and interfaces. As the ones at the top of the stream (excuse the pun) when it comes to their content, operators have a unique view on how their content is consumed across these devices. And with a unified approach and the right technology, they are uniquely positioned to take advantage of this.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 120, 1);

Come July and August, the weather is good, more people go on holiday and spend time outside, and viewing dips. It’s not like this globally – in the Middle East, there’s a winter slump – summer is peak viewing time, as 50 degree heat sends Middle Eastern families in search of the comforts of air conditioning and their flatscreen TVs. </p><p>What’s interesting is the way that OTT and TV Everywhere services are changing these dynamics. The summer slump has always led to a dogfight in the fall among operators wanting to pick up wavering subscribers around heavily promoted new shows or pieces of content.</p><p>What do you do, though, if you’re a global provider, and one not tethered to the schedule? The big sVoD players like Netflix, no longer stick to that traditional production calendar where they keep their best content back for the darker days of the year. Quite apart from anything else, they are a global provider, and as discussed above, there is no global \"peak\". Netflix launched its Stranger Things original at the height of summer, and critically at least, the show has been one of Netflix’s most successful (it currently boasts a whopping 94% score on Rotten Tomatoes). Netflix presumably had some idea it was on to a winner with Stranger Things, but still chose the height of summer to launch the show.</p><p>Unconventional, certainly, but probably smart. OTT providers can experience an even sharper spike in churn in the early summer, precisely because it is so easy cancel and save a couple of months’ subs before signing back on in September – again encouraging a bum fight for the returning souls. Having a hyped new show like Stranger Things helps companies like Netflix hold on to subs in an era of being able to instantly cancel your service.</p><p>We think there is an opportunity for MVPDs, too. TV Everywhere has definitely increased summer content consumption – on the beach, in people’s holiday apartments, on the plane, and so on. Services that let subscribers download and take their favourite content with them (Sky Go, BBC iPlayer), are tailor-made for this sort of use case – and for MVPDs, help them mop up some of those who have temporarily dropped their sVoD provider. It of course means having compelling content and promoting it, but also ensuring that it is as easy possible for subscribers to find what they would most enjoy watching at that time.</p><p>We all know now that content preferences vary with subscribers’ location, context and device as well as preferences and during summer, especially on holiday, they are looking for escapism. They also have more time on their hands and may be open to suggestions at the edge of their normal interests.</p><p>It is also worth noting that people who churn tend to watch less sport than those who do not, reflecting the pull of exclusive premium content in general. They also tend to watch somewhat less drama, but just as much if not more comedy and light entertainment. All these ideas can be combined to offer summer packages at the start of the season in an attempt to pre-empt some of this seasonal churn. It is true there will be a lot of sports viewing this summer in Olympic year, but a lot of that is Free To Air in many markets and the churn factor applies mostly to those who are not interested, as does the battle for eyeballs over the holidays.</p><p>The battle then is for subscriber retention in both senses, preventing churn but also attracting as much of their summer leisure time to your channels as possible. The two are after all intimately related. While it may be too late now for operators to make this into a good summer for subscriber retention, we can all start thinking about how we can do better next year.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 121, 6);

I particularly loved the decidedly analogue take on big data that Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec\'s hand-drawn postcard data <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://www.dear-data.com/theproject/\">visualizations</a> provided. And it\'s hard to disagree with Jonathan Harris\' <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"http://number27.org/data\">\"Data Will Help Us\"</a> - a manifesto of, as he puts it, the \"promises and perils of big data\", that closes the show.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, I found myself agreeing with almost all of Mills\' points which, given the article\'s title - Artists vs data...and art wins - and my line of work, may seem counter-intuitive. But we think there is a much closer relationship between the worlds of art and science, at least from a data perspective, than meets the eye.</p>\n\n<p>This isn\'t always obvious in TV-land. Take the the actual creation of the TV shows that we all know, watch and love. This has always been a polarising topic in the TV art vs. science debate, if you want to call it that. There\'s something intangible and magical about what makes some programmes good, or some great - or why some people love shows, and some don\'t. I\'ve never been able to get into The Leftovers on Sky Atlantic - yet I love most HBO output, Tom Perrotta - who wrote the books on which the show is based - and everything that Damon Lindeloff has put his name to (Prometheus, Lost, Star Trek).</p>\n\n<p>Netflix has been long been flying the flag for the use of data in its commissioning process. Its use of its famous (or infamous) algorithms are well known, and its use of data is, it says, a big factor in its success to date. But even this most scientific of attitudes still has art at its heart. Broadly speaking, Netflix\'s approach is not to look at what I\'m watching, and then try and commission or create programmes that it thinks I\'ll like. It takes pitches from commissioners, and then uses data to decide whether enough of its subscribers are likely to be interested in it for it to be worth it investing in the programme.</p>\n\n<p>There\'s a subtle distinction here. It isn\'t using data to replace the creative process - it\'s using data to better position things that come about as a result of the creative process. The great idea still comes first. Art plays a part in some of the more mechanical aspects of the use of data in TV, too. Take the humble art of segmenting your audience, which has been \"big data-ified\" in recent years. Once upon a time, a customer segmentation in TV-land was largely based on an operator\'s CRM, or any primary research on a sample of its customer base that it could get its hands on.</p>\n\n<p>The advent of return-path data (or \"big data\", if you must) has turned this on its head. An operator can now know exactly what all of its customers have watched, and when, and how. It\'s an amazing wealth of knowledge to draw upon when it comes to segmenting your audience. (I\'ve even heard people question the need for an exercise like a customer segmentation - but that\'s for another day).</p>\n\n<p>But there\'s still an awful lot of \"art\" that goes with this science. Very simply, data on its own isn\'t a silver bullet to answer all of your problems. And ultimately, the value of data does not lie in how many ones and zeros you have sitting in a data centre somewhere in the middle of the desert. It\'s how you use data to improve your business - be that to gain more customers, stop your existing customers leaving, sell more, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>And here\'s where the art part comes in. Presented with the same item, Van Gogh, Dali and Picasso would all paint it completely differently. Likewise, presented with the exact same set of data, three data science teams would likely come up with different views on what the data said, and what to do about it (although one hopes they\'d come to a closer consensus than Vincent, Salvador and Pablo would).</p>\n\n<p>Yet there are so many reasons - people\'s viewpoints, bias, experience and personalities - that make this the case. And that\'s before we even get into instinct - that wonderfully intangible element that make us say that even if the data says X, we know that the right is answer is Y.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason, we like to think of our data science team as data artists. We haven\'t quite got as far as getting them to put that on their business cards yet, but we do think that \"data science\" doesn\'t quite capture the essence of what they do.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone has a better idea, then answers on a (hand-drawn) postcard, please.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 122, 1);

It can help TV service providers take actions that boost their performance both on the bottom line and top line in the face of intensifying competition from online players in particular. The current European onslaught from Netflix will not have gone unnoticed amid some dazzling statistics. In Belgium 10% of Internet capacity was consumed by streaming content to the operator’s new subscribers within four days of the launch there. Our mission is to help operators respond to this threat by playing to their strengths both in provision of premium content and their relationship with customers, in the first instance by tapping data that until now they have not had access to. The traditional TV remote is a very good starting place since it is still the primary interface with the TV service for most consumers, despite all the talk about using smartphones and tablets.</p><p>If the remote is well designed it can encourage consumers to delve deeper into the catalogue and watch programs they might otherwise have missed. It can stimulate upselling and avoid the frustration resulting when failing to find desired content. The flip side is that a badly designed remote can quickly ferment customer dissatisfaction and preempt churn, while deterring browsing. We can drill down into how the remote control is faring with data across the customer base on which keys are used and how often they are pressed on a daily basis. Here we show an image from a typical operator highlighting how remote control design often leaves a lot to be desired. Perhaps operators focus too much on the UX behind the screen without considering that the remote can prevent their customers from enjoying its full scope.</p><p>Some of the data is fairly standard and of only passing interest from the UX perspective, such as the use of the volume and power buttons. But on this chart one item does stand out, the lack of engagement with the Guide, with less than half of users bothering with it at all and even those that do only pressing the button on average about twice a day. This is quite an indictment of the remote’s design by failing to give the Guide sufficient prominence or scope for exploration. The importance of the Guide as a differentiator has grown as the amount of content has proliferated, making it harder to find what you want from an increasingly long tail. This has been recognized by leading operators like BSkyB, which have recently revamped their Guides completely to give greater prominence to online content and typically introduce search capabilities for locating content by genre, actor, title and so on.</p><p>The impact of such new Guides can be assessed with the analysis that we can execute on the data we obtain. In the case of the above chart the operator must conclude that something is seriously wrong. It looks either like the Guide is so bad that customers aren’t using it, or more likely that the remote control is at fault by discouraging users from accessing it. It used to be said that all remotes were bad, but just that some weren’t too bad. Now armed with the data and more importantly the analysis we can provide, there is really no excuse any more for remote controls failing to do justice to the underlying service and the associated Guide. They should be enablers not barriers to a service.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', NULL, NULL, 123, 1);

Big promises were made that this would enable insights hitherto undreamed of about everything under the sun.</p><p>Pioneered in call centres and enterprise data services, Big Data has more recently invaded the worlds of video and pay TV. In many cases this calls for an integrated approach. To take a simple case, if a single MVPD client complains of loss of TV signal but finds that voice services are still available, just rebooting the set top box can probably solve the issue. If, however, voice services are also down, the issue is likely to be network related. On the other hand if multiple customers have issues, their geographic location may well pinpoint the probable cause.

RTB has become associated almost with a “measurement dividend”, with the idea that it is no longer necessary to invest as much assessing an ad’s effectiveness after it has played.</p>\n\n<p>Several studies have debased this assumption – most notably one from University College London, which found from analysis of conversion rates that the current bidding strategies are far from optimal. The study argued that there were “significant needs for optimisation algorithms incorporating the facts such as the temporal behaviours, the frequency and relevancy of the ad displays, which have not been well considered in the past.”</p>\n\n<p>This study focused on the online market, but this applies just as much to TV now that RTB is gaining ground rapidly for trading ad inventory there. Some major brands have announced plans to divert up to 75% of their digital ad budgets to programmatic buying over the next year. It is clear that RTB will require accurate measurement more than ever to drive analysis in near real time. Armed with accurate information the RTB algorithms can take account of response and feedback in near real time and use this to modify bidding strategy as campaigns unfold.</p>\n\n<p>This does beg the question of how to measure impact in near real time given that the full effect of many ads can only be assessed later after they have rippled across multiple channels and provoked delayed response among their target audience. This will inevitably require surrogate measures of impact that are predictive of the final outcome, based perhaps on engagement and viewing time. There is certainly no shortage of data that can be collected, as all media becomes increasingly measurable at ever deeper levels of granularity. We can now measure not just every media channel and campaign, but drill down across every outlet down to impressions and individual consumers, with increased capability to tune in to how ads are being consumed on the screen.</p>\n\n<p>The critical factor though is the actions that we can enable by analysing the data, which must be responsive to immediate feedback and sufficiently granular to identify specific aspects of a campaign that need adjusting during its course.

Once the data science team have successfully <a href=\"https://deductive.com/data-cleansing/\">cleansed these data sources</a> and ensured that each strand of data works properly, then is the time to join-up these various strands so that they can all seamlessly work together. Just as a soccer team requires eleven players to work together in a coordinated manner for the good of the team, so joined-up data can work together in a way that individual strands cannot do. We have already written about a <a href=\"https://deductive.com/tv-analytics-101-scv/\">single customer view</a> (SCV) where a company holds every piece of data about a customer in the same place, and this is a great illustration of when the data are joined-up and working. And with propensity modeling able to automate the processes that create an SCV through machine learning, it is feasible to have SCVs updated in real-time.</p>\n\n<p>Our data science consulting team recommends that any company which does not have SCVs in place for all its customers should do a gap analysis (which compares actual and desirable performance in the business) with the aim of creating said SCVs. The other important activity in creating joined-up date is data matching. We have written before about <a href=\"https://deductive.com/data-science-ip-matching/\">IP matching</a>, which is one type of data matching.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Getting the data joined up</strong><br>\nAlmost no business in 2019 will have to deal with just one dataset. There is so much useful data available that such a business would find itself rapidly outcompeted by its rivals with their multiple datasets and great cross-analysis between them. Successfully joining up these data sets represents what our data science consulting team can only describe as a huge prize for the enterprises which can do this successfully. In practical terms, the prize is an increased ability to execute its goals, drive its KPIs, and building an SCV.</p>\n\n<p>When you have two or more datasets that come from different sources, the same item, such as a somebody\'s name, their email address, their IP address or another identifier the company has assigned to the individual, may appear in several different datasets. Data matching can either be deterministic, where a perfect match is found, such as the same email address, or probabilistic matching. If deterministic matching works better than probabilistic matching, why would any company ever use the latter? The answer is <a href=\"https://deductive.com/data-science-gdpr-pseudonymization-data-pipeline/\">PII data</a>. We have written previously about the <a href=\"https://deductive.com/blinding-identity-taxonomy/\">46 elements which make up the BIT protocol</a>, and these 46 elements are what constitute PII data. If you are a company which does business in the EU, then you need to be extremely careful that your deterministic matching does not violate GDPR. However, probabilistic matching is also helpful in other examples. For instance, if a company has an IP address, and there are seven devices connected to it, but only five of them regularly connect to the IP address while the other two only connect occasionally then a probabilistic match might conclude that only the five belong to the household and that the other two are from visitors. This conclusion is reinforced when these two other devices are portable and appear more regularly in data from other locations.</p>\n\n<p>Data matching is particularly useful in helping a company understand its customers as well as in advertising its products and services, that is, marketing and sales. Examples of this include matching users of a subscription app which, among other things, advertises a particular product, with a database of email addresses for advertising the same product. By removing those who are both on the email database list and the subscription app from one of these two datasets, the company can avoid targeting the same users twice; thus both saving on advertising costs and preventing churn.</p>\n\n<p>Another matching example involves using some of the large databases held by information service providers (ISP) such as Experian and Acxiom, who segments users according to behavior, attitudes, and purchasing habits. If an enterprise has access to such a database, it can search for matches with its own customer database. If the business finds a match with a customer, it can then use the segmented info about the matched user in its own operations, e.g., targeting a user which the ISP database has segmented as a soccer fanatic with soccer-related advertising, or with sportswear if the customer already has a long history of making leisurewear purchases. Data matching is such a worthwhile activity with ISP databases because it is a much more potent tool than the demographics which advertisers traditionally used. So if the company is advertising a particular brand of truck it can save money by focussing its efforts on people with a track record of liking or purchasing trucks and this will be much more efficient, thus avoiding lots of wasted effort and money, than advertising to demographics which have a reasonable number of truck purchasers within them.</p>\n\n<p>Another area where matching is of interest to businesses is in understanding their customers better. All companies want better customer acquisition and retention, and many would like to upsell to them as well, and data matching can really help with all these activities. The more you know about a customer, the easier it becomes to engage with them, as well as to build products and services tailored for them, take them into consideration when doing business planning, tailoring marketing and increasing sales to them through providing insights into them for advertising to them. With an SCV in place which has already matched the particular customer to wherever she or he appears in any database held by the enterprise, joined-up data becomes a reality.</p>\n\n<p> </p>', 'Joined-Up Data', 'Getting the data joined-up', 'Data, Data Science, Data Integration', '', '', '', '', 0, 129, 1);

To date, however, much of that practice has been based on third-party data. For example, the methodology for identifying target audiences like ‘new truck intenders’ or ‘heavy users’ of a competing product is based on third-party data. </p>\n\n<p>I\'ve been mulling over the potential impacts of the new CCPA regulation and offer my thoughts in a two part series to help brands think about their use of first party data in this new environment and to suggest there is a growing opportunity for Linear TV, as the rules of the measurement game change with the advent of stricter privacy requirements.</p>\n\n<p>There are several reasons for industry dependency on third-party data. For one, many advertisers simply don’t have the necessary first-party data to deliver significant results. Others may have data but lack internal practices to extract it in a useful form. And lastly, some advertisers simply don’t want to share their consumer data with a third-party to apply it. For these reasons, early industry practice has in large part formed up around third-party data.</p>\n\n<p>For those in the trenches, this has been somewhat problematic because much of the third-party data used is really poor in quality. Many such audiences have been productized for digital advertisers where reach is key. Unfortunately, to achieve this reach, lower grade data often is piled into the audience. The problem, of course, is that ‘garbage in’ results in ‘garbage out.’</p>\n\n<p>With the advent of CCPA and related new, stiffer privacy regulations expected in many states in 2020, change is a certainty. In Europe, as GDPR rolled out, third-party data dried up, cookie pools shrank and digital advertising broadly reverted to contextual targeting. Though most privacy experts are still struggling to clarify the new US privacy regulations, there is no question that they will be more rigorous than GDPR. For this reason, we should expect at least the same changes — and likely even more impact on the U.S. market.</p>\n\n<p>What do such developments portend for DDL and, in particular, attribution? First, expect third party audience data to recede. The best sources of third-party data — publishers and brands — are the least likely to continue to contribute data to licensing pools. The new privacy laws are very specifically intended to give consumers control over their data and, as companies comply, they will have to become much more consumer-centric in their data strategies—for practicality, if nothing else. While advertisers have historically presumed that consumers will gladly share data for more relevant content, Forrester recently <a href=\"https://go.forrester.com/blogs/changing-attitudes-to-targeting-could-threaten-digital-ad-spending/\">reported</a> that “users are increasingly prioritizing the protection of their personal information over more relevant advertising.” If advertisers wish to continue licensing data, consumers will have to be given the option to opt out of their data being sold. For these reasons, many will simply stop licensing data to eliminate that point of friction with consumers.</p>\n\n<p>Also resulting from this same pressure point, expect a decline in the number of brands willing to share first-party data with third-party DDL service providers. This data-sharing requires disclosure to the consumer — to whom and for what purpose — and it requires the same opt-out offering, which is problematic. </p>\n\n<p>With these factors in play, advertisers will be drawn to the alternative of insourcing DDL programs. Generally speaking, while care and disclosure obligations will increase, new privacy laws do not impose stringent new limits on a company’s use of its own data. With appropriate disclosures, Brand X can readily match its own first party audience data to TV viewing data to identify content that delivers their target audience. That same match can be used to measure reach and frequency of ad exposures delivered by the campaign. And Brand X can readily compare prospects exposed to the ad to their own first-party data describing purchase of their product or service. </p>\n\n<p>For advertisers that collect and store their own consumer data, insourcing DDL — and in particular TV ad attribution — will deliver improved ad ROI, keep data safe and strategic insights internal, and successfully adapt measurement and attribution to the new rigors of privacy law in 2020.</p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 131, 110);

With less than a month until CCPA goes into effect,  industry organizations such as the IAB are <a href=\"https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IAB_Comments_on_Proposed_CCPA_Regulations_2019-12-06.pdf\" style=\"color: #0563c1; text-decoration: underline;\">now clamoring</a> to have the California attorney general backtrack on plans to require browser “do-not-track” requests be honored by the industry. </span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"\"> </p>\n\n<p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;\">When GDPR was implemented in Europe, the supply of digital identities dried up. Stricter regulations saw advertisers move away from public exchanges to private marketplaces with higher quality inventories according to <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/how-gdpr-is-moving-ad-budgets-toward-private-marketplaces\" style=\"color: #0563c1; text-decoration: underline;\">eMarketer</a>, and exchanges move to contextual targeting. CCPA and related state-by-state privacy regulations are forecast to be more stringent than GDPR and the intended effect — providing consumer control over their data — is inherently designed to eliminate large data structures formed around persons without their knowledge or control. CCPA will deflate the giant digital data bubble. </span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"\"> </p>\n\n<p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;\">So how can all of this be good for TV ad buyers and sellers? Well, first and foremost, there’s broadcasting. We’ve just recently figured out how to target, buy, measure and perform attribution on TV using granular data. Whereas digital advertising needs reach and thus tends to extend audiences with modeling and stuffing to make them ‘big,’ DDL is focused on the opposite. We’d much rather have a small, but very robust and accurate audience data set for targeting and a highly accurate first-party data set for outcomes – purchases, site visits, downloads, for example. Unlike digital advertising, DDL is based on statistics — not 1:1 reach.</span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"\"> </p>\n\n<p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;\">So, even though third party data sets may become smaller, if they are good quality, they can still be highly effective for audience-based targeting.    As well, it is completely possible to run DDL programs on first-party data and to do so in a privacy-compliant way. This means that, while digital ad spend will struggle to re-map as cookie pools evaporate and stricter browser policies on tracking and web analytics emerge, we have ways to sustain and expand data-driven TV to deliver historical digital virtues — targeting, measurement and results-based attribution — to TV ad spend. </span></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"\"> </p>\n\n<p style=\"\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri,sans-serif;\">While this, too, requires some re-mapping of practices, it’s very doable. History shows that ad investment will flow to the sources of ad inventory that are most targetable and measurable. With digital losing its 1:1 edge and Linear TV offering the higher quality engagement of large screens and a model that can more easily adapt to strict privacy regulations, it is quite possible that, going forward, ad spend will shift from digital back to Linear TV. </span></span></p>', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 0, 132, 110);

While there is no industry which doesn\'t urgently require the unique insights that data can provide, my focus is on media corporations, who urgently need to understand how the behavior of both consumer and advertisers are changing, both during and after lockdown. We all know that ad-spending is down, and demand for TV is sky-rocketing as many people remain at home on lockdown. Data, accurately measured and understood using already-established data science techniques, can give a much more precise and detailed picture of what is happening currently and what is likely to occur in the future.</p>\n\n<p>It is marketers within a media company who are communicating with advertisers and brands, including those who are choosing not to advertise during the pandemic. Can we give them insights into the changing consumption patterns of viewers, both in terms of what they watch and of what they are purchasing now and will likely want to buy as we overcome COVID-19? As data science teams, we need to comprehend and convey the current and future trends to the marketing teams, and the high-level executives who will make critical decisions about the business and its future.</p>\n\n<p>Marketers need to retain and keep building relationships with advertising brands, and if they can give them positive but realistic messages about consumer behavior. Based not on wishful thinking but measurable data trends, they can strengthen the broadcaster/advertiser relationship and help brands who are still advertising to tailor and target their ads for the best possible outcome in terms of positive consumer response.</p>\n\n<p>With first China and then Europe becoming the primary hotspots for the pandemic, data about how brands and consumers behave in those regions while adjusting for cultural differences can be an excellent place to start, as can historical data about pandemics and how they pan out. People did not have televisions during the Spanish flu pandemic 100 years ago, but they certainly did make purchases, and advertising did exist.</p>\n\n<p>Data concerning coming out of quarantine is as vital as data about behavior during lockdowns as these two phases see a very different response from both brands and consumers. Part of the challenge is to determine which lockdown behaviors consumers will keep adopting in a post-corona-crisis world and which won\'t?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Media Winners and Losers</strong><br>\nIf there is any upside, it is that people are trying new things, such as higher rates of digital adoption. While this is better news for some media corporations than for others, those more negatively affected need to change their way of doing things, and the sooner, the better. A good data science team can save those companies from going under, particularly when the data insights are rapidly taken on board by the high-level executives. This need for accurate insights also puts even more pressure than usual on data science teams to get things right.</p>\n\n<p>With many people stuck at home self-isolating, daytime TV is the big clear winner, whether this is Pay TV or OTT. And while the popularity of both streaming and free content is increasing, the data indicates that cable TV services can also benefit due to people\'s desire for reliable news sources, with some brands now choosing to advertise on news shows where they were reluctant to do so before</p>\n\n<p>News viewership is up 25%, while consumers are focusing mainly on local news, according to Nielsen, unquestionably a useful source of data insights to add to the mix of datasets.</p>\n\n<p>Another winner is children\'s TV, with many kids off school and stuck at home. OTT seems to be the big winner, with data indicating that cord-cutting is accelerating. However, subscription fatigue is also a reality, especially within the streaming wars. Subscribing to several of these may not be an option for people for whom money has suddenly become very tight, making ad-supported OTT services appear a better option than before the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>A big issue for all broadcasters is content itself. There are no live sports, though esports and gaming are becoming a popular alternative. Typically the process of producing original content begins with a new script appearing months before filming begins. More importantly, viewers want relevant content, and a lot of content commissioned before the crisis may feel stale to consumers who might, for instance, prefer documentaries about health care rather than dramas about fictional events that feel irrelevant to them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Changing Consumer Behavior</strong><br>\nOne significant indicator of changes in consumer behavior is that consumers want to support companies that do their bit fighting this virus. Consumers feel tempted to boycott companies that display selfish behavior and appear indifferent to the plight of said consumers on lockdown. So viewers will probably respond better to a brand reinforcing the message to stay at home rather than one whose only interest appears to be in selling the brand\'s products.</p>\n\n<p>While the demand for some products is increasing, others have dwindled. It\'s not because of a lack of demand, but because lockdown has shut down retail. While online shopping is working flat out without fully meeting all customer needs, we may find demand super-charged for certain items when lockdowns end. If a media corporation can reassure brands with robust data that the demand for their products has only dwindled temporarily, this can help these brands prepare for future demand as well as encouraging them to keep advertising, either now or when lockdown finishes.</p>\n\n<p>Other shifts in consumer purchasing patterns that currently available data are indicating include a keen interest in products that promote health and wellbeing, a tendency to buy more groceries, especially ones which aren\'t perishable. Purchases are going to be lower overall because of temporary layoffs, unemployment, and a feeling of insecurity as well as the sheer difficulty of buying products when online shopping is overwhelmed with orders, and consumers fear the health risks of entering stores. All are likely to result in more competitive markets, where the likely winners will be those firms that understand changed consumer behavior and reach out to consumers.</p>\n\n<p>Another dramatic shift that currently available data indicates is happening already is higher rates of technology adoption as people look to technology to solve their problems, with online shopping and teleworking being the two most notable examples. There is an opportunity for companies to leverage technologies to meet changing consumer demand and to give customers a positive experience. In an environment where people miss many aspects of their old lives, they crave positive experiences and seamless interactions. They do not want negative experiences.</p>\n\n<p>Those companies which perform best are likely to gain loyal customer long after we have beaten COVID-19. Many companies are aware of the need to make investments to meet the new demands, especially in cases like online shopping where adoption of new habits is likely to be permanent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Changing brand behavior</strong><br>\nIt is essential for media companies to understand how different types of brands are changing their behavior, even if they don\'t share said data insights with the brands themselves. Some brands are benefiting from increased demand: online shopping, supermarkets, and the brands that sell their products there, telecommunications, and anything connected to telework (such as the unstoppable rise of Zoom) and all those providing the products and services which people continue to consume in quarantine. These fortunate brands are likely to continue advertising. However, data indicates that avoiding advertising over-exposure (churn) is very important to successful advertising.</p>\n\n<p>If before COVID-19, a household watched a couple of hours of TV a night and typically saw a particular ad every day, now they might be watching eight hours of telly a day and be exposed to this same ad four times a day. High frequency always results in boredom and even distaste towards the brand. Churn is a relevant example of why measuring such factors as how much typical television households are watching in lockdown and the ads they are seeing is so important for media companies to understand.</p>\n\n<p>Showing solidarity with the COVID-19 crisis and those suffering is becoming increasingly important to brands. For instance, Coco-Cola has stopped all advertising and instead committed the money they would have spent on helping overcome the crisis. Media companies that survive through advertising also need to display their commitment to helping make things better during the crisis while reinforcing advertising as a positive and not a harmful, greed-based activity.</p>\n\n<p>Media companies collaborate with advertisers to ensure that ads engage with consumers as they are right now on lockdown. Keep the tone helpful and informative, and as we come out of lockdown - in what we hope will be the near future - this will only benefit the ad industry\'s long-term reputation.</p>', 'Media Data Science under Covid-19', 'An article examining the changes covid-19 is bringing to data science n the media industry', 'Data Science, Covid-19', '', '', '', '', 0, 134, 1);

The provider of automatic content recognition (ACR) data, which recently surpassed a consumer opt-in footprint of 15 million Smart TVs in the US, says it is continuing to enable new use cases for media companies, agencies and technology platforms reshaping the way TV is bought, sold and measured.</p>\n\n<p>The NRP, developed in partnership with Deductive, provides representative TV viewing data for all US households, demographics and geographies built on Inscape’s base of 15 million ACR-enabled Smart TVs—the largest commercially available data set of its kind. The NRP applies anonymous consumer data from the most reputable sources to make Inscape data representative across a broad set of consumer and household attributes.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, building on parent company VIZIO’s extensive geographic reach across all US markets, Inscape has extended local affiliate attribution of major broadcast stations to all 210 local markets in the United States. Now, users of Inscape data can report more granularly at the local level and determine the localisation of scheduled content start times for live or time shifted viewings as well as understand which connected devices or apps within the TV were used to play the content allowing for better attribution and measurement.</p>\n\n<p>“We’re extremely confident in the efficacy of our new NRP model and believe that being open about how we’ve constructed it will further drive confidence within the ecosystem both for the value of our new offering as well as the role smart TV data is playing across the industry,” said Zeev Neumeier, President of Inscape. “We’ll be looking to make ongoing extensions and enhancements and continue to invest in making it the gold standard for our licensees and their customers.”</p>\n\n<p>With the surge in TV viewing, Inscape is entering a new phase of its evolution. Its ACR viewing data is now widely adopted by companies invested in new forms of measurement, attribution and cross channel targeting. More than ever before, household-level targeting is an important metric for marketers who want to understand the impact of programming specific to locations and granular audience targets.</p>\n\n<p>“We’re proud to work with Inscape on their currency-class NRP, which leverages our background in TV measurement and combines our advanced data models with the industry’s largest commercially available ACR data set to provide advertisers with granular viewing data on even niche, hard-to-reach targets,” stated Tom Weiss, CTO and Chief Data Scientist, Deductive. “The Inscape NRP addresses one of the toughest challenges in the TV measurement space today—namely, how to create a dataset that is both granular enough to represent viewing in a fragmented TV landscape, and that accurately represents the broad range of demographics and targets that advertisers are interested in. We look forward to sharing our approach with the industry and applying feedback to make it ever better.”</p>', 'The new audience panel from Inscape', 'Inscape has developed a new National Representative Panel in partnership with Deductive.', 'Data Science, TV data, TV viewing', '', '', '', '', 0, 138, 8);

We explore the three types of datasets, i.e., Panel Data, typified by Nielsen, set-top-box (STB) data, and data from Smart TVs. While some of the challenges and problems we find solutions for can be achieved solely using one type of dataset, others need a combination of two or three of the dataset types. We examine whether to combine datasets into a single panel or keep them separate and how to combine them by making them consistent. We explore the truncation or edit rules used to achieve consistency. We also delve into deduplication for when viewers have both an STB and a Smart TV. We then look at the highly significant issue of how to ensure combined datasets are nationally representative, focusing on geographic and demographic effects, and the impact privacy and opt-out regulations may have on constructing this nationally representative picture. We go on to probe program rating viewership using combined datasets, including live network, live program and time-shifted ratings, the problems arising from working with changing populations (changes in the way populations access TV, e.g., cord-cutting, etc.), household and individual viewing (not necessarily the same thing), and modeling household level viewing.</p>\n\n<p>The White Paper concludes by looking at advertising ratings using combined datasets, including using them as run logs, native smart TV ad detection, measuring addressable, local and MVPD inserts, and exploring best practices when it comes to the critically important area of ad measurement, and how Smart TV native ad detection is the best way to measure advertising because it can cover not only national and local but also MVPD and addressable too.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mcusercontent.com/bbc181c719346db92b148ef0f/files/b235eed2-171f-4663-9779-9e840de737ce/Dativa_Best_practices_in_integrating_stb_smart_tv_and_panel_data.pdf?download=1\">Download Now</a></p>\n\n<p> </p>', 'Deductive\'s Best Practices white paper', 'You can download our free Best Practices white paper here.', 'best practices, white paper, dataset integration, STB data, Smart TV data, panel data', '', '', '', '', 0, 139, 8);

Tom predicts that people in the industry are shortly going to stop talking about how enormous datasets are and will instead focus on the expertise of their in-house analysts to identify which are the right datasets to use for any given problem. The process of taking these big datasets and dealing with them in-house is one that Dativa is seeing plenty of recently and we predict that this is a trend which will, and equally importantly certainly should, be happening a lot more.</p>\n\n<p>In 2020, everyone is building their own data platforms using their own first-party data, and this process is dominated by digital.

They start by outlining the problem: customers come full of praise about the new Inscape Smart TV or the set-top-box (STB) datasets, but they find them skewed by varying degrees.   To use the data for measurement, we need to find a solution.   Active panels, such as those managed by Nielsen, address skew  e.g., an under-representation of African-American representation, by simply recruiting more African-Americans. Passive panels such as those populated by data collected from consumer devices cannot recruit specific households, and so we need to weight households to address skew.</span></p>\n\n<p>&lt;iframe allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vuiF0HUiH0s\" width=\"560\"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</p>\n\n<div style=\"\">Dativa\'s data science consulting team has created a new product known as NRP to address the skews in the Inscape Smart TV  datasets by assigning a weight to each TV household.

The process of taking these big datasets and dealing with them in-house is one that Dativa is seeing plenty of recently and we predict that this is a trend which will, and equally importantly certainly should, be happening a lot more.</p>\n\n<p>In 2020, everyone is building their own data platforms using their own first-party data, and this process is dominated by digital. Those companies that don\'t already have a D2C service are in the process of launching one, and what they all find is they have to cope with gigabytes of new data on a daily basis. Tom states that what really excites him is not combining STB and Smart TV datasets but combining either one with streaming data.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of the streaming data is connected TV data, and this is a booming area right now. With linear, Michael sees that the skews and biases tend to be driven by demographics and not by the TV provider. In contrast, CTV data is subject to platform bias, including what apps are available and how much the particular app emphasizes user experience.</p>', 'Datasets,Transparency', '2020-08-06 08:34:46.000000');

To use the data for measurement, we need to find a solution. Active panels, such as those managed by Nielsen, address skew e.g., an under-representation of African-American representation, by simply recruiting more African-Americans. Passive panels such as those populated by data collected from consumer devices cannot recruit specific households, and so we need to weight households to address skew.</p>', '<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"135\">This week, Michael and Tom discuss the National Representative Panel (NRP).

Passive panels such as those populated by data collected from consumer devices cannot recruit specific households, and so we need to weight households to address skew.</p>\n\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"793\">Deductive\'s data science consulting team has created a new product known as NRP to address the skews in the Inscape Smart TV datasets by assigning a weight to each TV household. So if there is a lack of data about Hispanic viewers, Deductive increases the weight assigned to the Hispanic viewers the dataset does contain.</p>\n\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"1117\">As other platforms have their methods for dealing with skews, Michael asks why advertisers would particularly benefit from using Deductive\'s new NRP product. The main answer is transparency. NRP is based on a completely transparent methodology. A second issue is focus. Deductive is working to make the best weighting system possible. Michael thinks we are probably putting a bit more into it than others. Deductive can also create customized weights, so firms can compare their datasets with Inscape datasets. Transparency allows companies and their partners to see what has been taken care of in the datasets and where weaknesses still exist.</p>\n\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"1776\">The pair then discuss the use cases where it makes most sense to apply the NRP . These cases include any measurement use cases, and particularly attribution, and measuring uplift of sales. For things like retargeting, NRP isn\'t necessary.</p>\n\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"2017\">NRP is easy to use and works in the same way as say panel data from Nielsen. New privacy laws, and particularly CCPA, which allow people to opt-out of having their data stored, creates challenges. Opt outs need to be removed from the panel going forward, as well as all previous iterations of the panel. As a result, Deductive has to recalculate new weights weekly - for current and past iterations - to ensure the panel remains accurate while respecting the rights of those who have just opted-out.</p>', 'NRP,TV,Panel,Inscape', '2020-08-06 08:35:07.000000');

Before sharing or uploading any data including any personal data you hold for the purpose of cleansing using the Data Pipeline API, you must consider all the legal implications of doing so. Your ability to share information is subject to a number of legal constraints, which go beyond the requirements of the Data Protection Act (DPA). There may well be other considerations such as specific statutory prohibitions on sharing, copyright restrictions or a duty of confidence that may affect your ability to share personal data. A duty of confidence may be stated, or it may be implied by the content of the information or because it was collected in circumstances where confidentiality is expected – medical or banking information, for example. You may need to seek your own legal advice on these issues and will be fully responsible for sharing any personal data with the Data Pipeline API. </p>\n\n<p>(c) You are responsible for ensuring any personal consent for data submitted through the API. We are a Data Processor for personal data submitted through the API. 8.3 We may disclose your personal information to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries.

Events outside our control</strong></p>\n\n<p>10.1 We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations under this Licence that is caused by an Event Outside Our Control. An Event Outside Our Control is defined below in condition 11.2. </p>\n\n<p>10.2 An Event Outside Our Control means any act or event beyond our reasonable control, including without limitation failure of public or private telecommunications networks. </p>\n\n<p>10.3 If an Event Outside Our Control takes place that affects the performance of our obligations under this Licence: </p>\n\n<p>(a) our obligations under this Licence will be suspended and the time for performance of our obligations will be extended for the duration of the Event Outside Our Control; and </p>\n\n<p>(b) we will use our reasonable endeavours to find a solution by which our obligations under this Licence may be performed despite the Event Outside Our Control.</p>\n\n<p><strong>11. Other important terms</strong></p>\n\n<p>11.1 Use of the API is protected by a unique API authentication token (\"Token\") that is tied to your account. You will not share the Token with any third parties who are not authorised to use the Data Pipeline API on your behalf and acknowledge that any use of the API using the Token may incur charges under the Licence Fee. If you accidentally share this Token with third parties you must contact us immediately or become liable to any charges associated with use of the Token by third parties. </p>\n\n<p>11.2 We may transfer our rights and obligations under this Licence to another organisation, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under this Licence.</p>\n\n<p>11.3 You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under this Licence to another person if we agree in writing. </p>\n\n<p>11.4 This Licence and any document expressly referred to in it constitutes the entire agreement between us and supersedes and extinguishes all previous agreements, promises, assurances, warranties, representations and understandings between us, whether written or oral, relating to its subject matter. You agree that you shall have no remedies in respect of any statement, representation, assurance or warranty (whether made innocently or negligently) that is not set out in this Licence or any document expressly referred to in it. You agree that you shall have no claim for innocent or negligent misrepresentation or negligent misstatement based on any statement in this in this Licence or any document expressly referred to in it. </p>\n\n<p>11.5 If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under this Licence, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.</p>\n\n<p>11.6 Each of the conditions of this Licence operates separately. If any court or competent authority decides that any of them are unlawful or unenforceable, the remaining conditions will remain in full force and effect.  </p>');

INSERT INTO `djangocms_text_ckeditor_text` VALUES (9723, '<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"249\">Attribution Pro is a toolset that brands, agencies and media sellers can use to create, track, optimize and analyze cross-platform attribution campaigns, either in-house or as part of a managed service.</p>\n\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"453\">Our approach to attribution differs from others in the market. We do not offer an off-the-shelf product. We have a reference approach that customers can immediately use to start creating and measuring campaigns. But most customers have additional or specific needs and requirements about how campaigns should be set up or reported on, so we will adapt our technical and reporting needs to fit these requirements. We don’t try to fit square pegs in round holes. We offer a best-of-both worlds between the flexibility of building a tool in house, and the ease and simplicity of using something off-the-shelf.</p>\n\n<h2>Components of Attribution Pro</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Data Sources Diagram\" src=\"https://static.deductive.com/img/data-sources-image.png\"></p>\n\n<h3>Data Sources</h3>\n\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"1017\">Any attribution campaign requires reliable data to define the target groups and outcomes we want to measure, and the media and ads that we use to define the campaign we are tracking. Deductive has relationships with dozens of data providers that we can bring to create specific and granular target groups. We have a best-in-breed approach to target and outcome creation and we can advise customers on which providers are the best fit for their specific use case. Alternatively, customers can bring their own target, outcome and media data and relationships.</p>\n\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"1577\">We have expertise in using MVPD and ACR data to define TV, including connected TV campaigns. The Deductive pixel is widely deployed across hundreds of publishers that we use to define digital campaigns, and we have relationships with multiple DSPs to onboard CTV and OTT ads data.</p>\n\n<h3>Attribution Engine</h3>\n\n<p>Our attribution engine is the model that brings all of the data together to define who in the target audience was exposed to the campaign, who converted, and which platform was most effective at driving conversion. This includes our matching engine, where we use a combination of probabilistic and deterministic matching technologies to bring all of the data sources together to define a cross platform view.</p>\n\n<h3>Shapley Values</h3>\n\n<p>It also includes our unique source contribution multi touch attribution methodology. While most attribution providers are using single touch conversion rates, we take a more holistic approach, looking at how different parts of the media buy perform in combination - not in isolation. We use this to provide a deduplicated view of which platforms drove outcomes, and which did not, layering costs on top to show advertisers where they are getting the most bang for their buck.</p>\n\n<h3>Making it Representative</h3>\n\n<p>At this stage we also apply the weights we use to make our TV data nationally representative. All big TV datasets have skews in them. We apply weights at the demographic and geographic level and also make adjustments for numbers of TVs in the household, and how the TVs are used, to ensure that the results we present are as close to nationally representative as we can make them</p>\n\n<h3>Reporting</h3>\n\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"3154\">We offer a web-based self-serve tool that customers use to easily set up and track campaigns, updated on a daily basis. We offer a number of options for mid- or final-campaign reporting (Excel, PowerPoint, Tableau/BI reporting tool, etc.).</p>\n\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"3392\">We offer dozens of views out of the box (reach/frequency analysis; platform breakdown; creative breakdown, etc.) and we can design and customize reporting requirements that integrate with how the business uses and sees data.</p>\n\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"3612\">We know that the value of a campaign report is greatest immediately after a campaign is completed, so we look to turn reporting around in weeks after the campaign rather than months. As a professional services company we can also take a more consultative approach to campaign reporting by helping the customer to interpret the data and use it to optimize future activity.</p>');

INSERT INTO `djangocms_text_ckeditor_text` VALUES (11797, '<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"249\">Attribution Pro is a toolset that brands, agencies and media sellers can use to create, track, optimize and analyze cross-platform attribution campaigns, either in-house or as part of a managed service.</p>\n\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"453\">Our approach to attribution differs from others in the market. We do not offer an off-the-shelf product. We have a reference approach that customers can immediately use to start creating and measuring campaigns. But most customers have additional or specific needs and requirements about how campaigns should be set up or reported on, so we will adapt our technical and reporting needs to fit these requirements. We don’t try to fit square pegs in round holes. We offer a best-of-both worlds between the flexibility of building a tool in house, and the ease and simplicity of using something off-the-shelf.</p>\n\n<h2>Components of Attribution Pro</h2>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Data Sources Diagram\" src=\"https://static.deductive.com/img/data-sources-image.png\"></p>\n\n<h3>Data Sources</h3>\n\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"1017\">Any attribution campaign requires reliable data to define the target groups and outcomes we want to measure, and the media and ads that we use to define the campaign we are tracking. Deductive has relationships with dozens of data providers that we can bring to create specific and granular target groups. We have a best-in-breed approach to target and outcome creation and we can advise customers on which providers are the best fit for their specific use case. Alternatively, customers can bring their own target, outcome and media data and relationships.</p>\n\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"1577\">We have expertise in using MVPD and ACR data to define TV, including connected TV campaigns. The Deductive pixel is widely deployed across hundreds of publishers that we use to define digital campaigns, and we have relationships with multiple DSPs to onboard CTV and OTT ads data.</p>\n\n<h3>Attribution Engine</h3>\n\n<p>Our attribution engine is the model that brings all of the data together to define who in the target audience was exposed to the campaign, who converted, and which platform was most effective at driving conversion. This includes our matching engine, where we use a combination of probabilistic and deterministic matching technologies to bring all of the data sources together to define a cross platform view.</p>\n\n<h3>Shapley Values</h3>\n\n<p>It also includes our unique source contribution multi touch attribution methodology. While most attribution providers are using single touch conversion rates, we take a more holistic approach, looking at how different parts of the media buy perform in combination - not in isolation. We use this to provide a deduplicated view of which platforms drove outcomes, and which did not, layering costs on top to show advertisers where they are getting the most bang for their buck.</p>\n\n<h3>Making it Representative</h3>\n\n<p>At this stage we also apply the weights we use to make our TV data nationally representative. All big TV datasets have skews in them. We apply weights at the demographic and geographic level and also make adjustments for numbers of TVs in the household, and how the TVs are used, to ensure that the results we present are as close to nationally representative as we can make them</p>\n\n<h3>Reporting</h3>\n\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"3154\">We offer a web-based self-serve tool that customers use to easily set up and track campaigns, updated on a daily basis. We offer a number of options for mid- or final-campaign reporting (Excel, PowerPoint, Tableau/BI reporting tool, etc.).</p>\n\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"3392\">We offer dozens of views out of the box (reach/frequency analysis; platform breakdown; creative breakdown, etc.) and we can design and customize reporting requirements that integrate with how the business uses and sees data.</p>\n\n<p data-renderer-start-pos=\"3612\">We know that the value of a campaign report is greatest immediately after a campaign is completed, so we look to turn reporting around in weeks after the campaign rather than months. As a professional services company we can also take a more consultative approach to campaign reporting by helping the customer to interpret the data and use it to optimize future activity.</p>');
